		 constraint is processed like continuous (which
		 doesn't actually exist for discrete system). It is
		 argued that only densely dotted patterns have
		 distinguished points that act as endpoints (e.g. in
		 Kanizsa edge and sun illusion). Also use alternating
		 opposite contrast dots and find the density depends
		 on similar polarity dots. N.B.: The misconception of
		 small RF==tangent, large RF==curvature is promulgated
		 here, even though the Nature paper is cited. SWZ
		 still at his 1985 formulation.}
