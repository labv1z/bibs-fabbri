  keywords =	{Recover the underlying (curve) smoothed point
		  coordinates. Describing linked edge points at a range
		  of scales by selecting intervals of the curve and
		  scales of smoothing likely to represent the scene
		  structure. Look at the rate of change of curvature.
		 Minimize the rate of change of curvature (threshold).
		 Maximize the lengths of the curve intervals (search
		  across multiple scales).
		 Solution to the shrinkage of curves during Gaussian
		  smoothing. Correction is a function of: (a) the degree
		  of smoothing (sigma) and (b) a monotonic function of
		  curvature.

		 o ...corner detection...on the basis of global
		   properties... (p.559)
		 o ...low-pass Gaussian filtering...(permits) precise
		   control in the frequencies that are filtered from the
		   original data. (p.559)
		 o ...orientation...smoothed...more suited...(for)
		   calculating discontinuites of curvature... (p.559)
		 o ...use of a non-linear operator to select and mark
		   (image discontinuities)... (p.560)
		 o ... smoothing of (both) curves and ... the original
		   image ... must take place. (p.559)
		 o ...case of Gaussian filtered curves, the high
		   frequencies have all been removed and...do not
		   influence...higher derivatives. (p.564)
		 o ...combine smoothing and segmentation at multiple
		   scales... (p.565)
