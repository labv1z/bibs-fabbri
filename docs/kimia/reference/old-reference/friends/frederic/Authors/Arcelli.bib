		 chessboard.
		 Detection of the set of quenching points by the use
		 of local operations. Interactions among wavefronts
		 originating from different sources arise wherever 2
		 equilabeled (i.e., same distance) wavefronts are
		 4-adjacent to each other ( --> qp) or partially
		 overlapped ( --> qp*).
		 Local property of qp* with label "t": has in its
		 neighborhood two 4-components of pixels labeled
		 "t-1".
		 Set of quenching points, Q, include the pixels with
		 locally maximal label. Q may be regarded as the
		 border line separating regions of the plane where the
		 influence of a given source is stronger than any
		 other.
		 PROBLEM: If 2 interacting sources have an equal
		 Cartesian coordinate --> 8-internal pixels are
		 present in Q --> an ever increasing number of pixels
		 satisfying the equidistance property is found at any
		 time greater than "t".
		 SOLUTION: Allow propagation from a quenching point
		 labeled "t + k" (k >= 0) to only one pixel belonging
		 to any adjacent 4-connected component labeled
		 "t + k + 1". [ See Meyer88Skeletons ]
		 SHAPE SPLITTING: Segmentation based on a proper
		 sequence of contraction [erosions] and expansion
		 [dilations] operations [ --> opening ], imposing that
		 the picture topology be preserved while expanding
		 certain picture subsets [ see Suzuki82Fusion ].
		 Contraction [erosion] --> thresholding the DT.
		 [ Geodesic DT is then described ! ]
		 Segmentation paths are found in correspondence with
		 pairs of distinct contour arcs delimiting regions of
		 the clump which can be perceived as NECKS.
