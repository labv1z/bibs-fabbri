		 opening operations (2D binary image filtering). For
		 each ``scale'' (i.e., radius of structuring ball) an
		 approximation of curvature is computed using a
		 ``DoS'' method with a fixed-length stick measuring
		 element (of length ``L''). How to select ``L'' is not
		 discussed. Why concavities are not filtered is not
		 discussed either. Makes comparisons with Gaussian
		 (1D) filtering methods; in particular the feature of
		 not introducing new zero-crossings for increasing
		 scales is demonstrated.}
