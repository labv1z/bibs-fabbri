		 Metrics on the space of shapes: Hausdorff, d_H
		  (L^infty - type; sensitive to outliers); template,
		  d_T (L^1 - type; totally insensitive to outliers);
		  transport, d_M (weights equally all points; fuzzy
		  boundaries); optimal diffeomorphism, d_O ("energies"
		  of diff. geom. -- 1st derivatives -- or elasticity
		  theory -- 2nd derivatives); maps with tears, d_A;
		  graph matching, d_G.
		 Asymmetry of matrices of similarity (A (e.g., 99)
		  similar to B (e.g., 100) but not the contrary).
		 Adaptive resonace theory: Feature vectors and
		  flexible templates must both be used in an iterative
		  architecture involving closely coupled bottom-up and
		  top-down stages.}
