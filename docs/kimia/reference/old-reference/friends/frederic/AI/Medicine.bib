  abstract =	{In this dissertation, we describe a medical image
		 understanding system whose reasoning module employs
		 the profound features of Dempster-Shafer theory.
		 Given a set of three correlated images acquired from
		 x-ray CT, $T\sb1$-, and $T\sb2$-weighted modalities
		 at the same slicing level and angle of a human brain,
		 the proposed system is capable of mimicking the
		 reasoning process of a human expert in recognizing
		 the image set based on (1) the knowledge about sensor
		 characteristics, (2) the knowledge about anatomical
		 structures, and (3) the knowledge about image
		 processing and analysis tools. To implement such
		 complicated processes, the blackboard architecture
		 composed of three major components, knowledge
		 sources, blackboard data structure, and control is
		 adopted. The proposed system consists of three
		 phases. In phase one, entities in the form of regions
		 and curves with associated features are extracted
		 from the images. The second and the third phases aim
		 at recognizing the physically meaningful entities in
		 the image set. In phase two, the system tries to
		 identify the major anatomies and locate the slice in
		 the model that is most similar to the image set under
		 study. In phase three, the selected model slice is
		 used to refine the formation of the identified
		 anatomical structures and extract gray and white
		 matters.}

  abstract =	{In this dissertation, we develope an automated
		 three-dimensional (3-D) medical image registration
		 system. Registration is an image analysis technique
		 that integrates anatomical and/or functional
		 information from images acquired by different
		 modalities or at different times for the improvement
		 of medical diagnosis and treatment. Our proposed
		 system is a surface fitting based system with
		 accuracy on the order of the image pixel sizes. The
		 surface fitting technique extracts the external
		 surface contours of two or more sets of images, and
		 employs an optimization scheme to fit the contour
		 sets together. The proposed automated system contains
		 three main subsystems for automated contour
		 extraction, surface model matching, and reformatting
		 correlated images, respectively. Our system has
		 eliminated the heavy human expert involvement
		 previously required in all of the image registration
		 systems. In the contour extraction phase, algorithms
		 equipped with domain-specific knowledge are able to
		 extract the external surface contours of various
		 brain images without any assistance from human. In
		 the surface model matching phase, our system has the
		 ability to circumvent the local minimum problem
		 encountered quite frequently in many optimization
		 problems. Moreover, we have added a final matching
		 step to fine-tune the results from an initial
		 matching step. The error measurement in the final
		 matching phase is the most accurate measurement
		 available and it is therefore more effective in
		 guiding the optimization process. In our system,
		 there is no need for special clinical procedure and
		 external devices during image acquisition, as such
		 images obtained from routine clinical practice can be
		 used directly for registration. Our system also has
		 the ability to handle non-completely overlapping
		 scans, as such images with different scanning
		 orientations (axial, sagittal, or coronal) can be
		 registered in a homogeneous manner without special
		 human assistance. Our system has been successfully
		 applied to register images acquired from X-ray
		 computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging
		 (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). This
		 system is expected to facilitate the process of
		 employing accurately correlated medical images for
		 medical treatment and diagnosis.}

  abstract =	{Clinical electromyography relies on subjective,
		 qualitative assessment of the EMG signal. Manual
		 quantitative methods have not gained widespread use,
		 in part because they are tedious. Several computer
		 assisted methods have been developed. Most of these
		 methods require considerable user interaction. Fully
		 automated methods have not been entirely successful,
		 because of a lack of robustness in the face of
		 varying and complex signals. Neural network signal
		 processing methods have recently been shown to have
		 significant robustness in processing complex,
		 degraded, noisy and unstable signals. A novel
		 approach to automated EMG signal decomposition, based
		 on a neural network processing architecture, has been
		 developed and is presented in this dissertation. Due
		 to the lack of a priori knowledge of EMG signals, the
		 neural network must be trained in an unsupervised
		 manner. An unsupervised neural network classifier,
		 consisting of a multi-layer perceptron neural network
		 and a pseudo-unsupervised training strategy, is
		 proposed in this dissertation. The network learns
		 repetitive appearances of motor unit potential (MUP)
		 waveforms from their suspected occurrences in
		 filtered EMG signal. The same training waveforms are
		 fed into the trained neural network and the output of
		 the neural network is fedback to give rise to a
		 dynamic retrieval net classifier. Features discovered
		 by the neural network are collected as feature
		 vectors associated with each input waveform.
		 Classification is achieved by comparing those feature
		 vectors. Firing information of each MUP is further
		 used to refine the classification results of the
		 neural network classifier. Then individual MUPs are
		 derived and their firing tables are created. Some
		 potential useful features are extracted from the
		 averaged MUPs and their firing tables for diagnostic
		 purposes. The automated decomposition of EMG
		 utilizing an artificial neural network is robust
		 because its behavior mimics more closely that of
		 human beings than traditional signal processing and
		 pattern recognition methods. The proposed method is
		 capable of decomposing an EMG signal containing up to
		 11 MUPs.}
