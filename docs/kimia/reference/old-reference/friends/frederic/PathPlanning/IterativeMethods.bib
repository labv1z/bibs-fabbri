		 Function-space: at each iteration a problem different

			--> Monotone NON-DECREASING cost function.
			--> Contour Processed DT's.
		 Policy-space: at each iteration a NON-OPTIMAL
		 	solution of the original problem is solved.
			--> Monotone NON-INCREASING cost function.
			--> Raster Scan DT's.
		 Ordinary iterative methods:
			Values of the unknowns at the kth iteration
		 	can be obtained from the values at the (k-1)th
		 	iteration only.
			--> Contour Processed DT's.
		 Seidel iterative methods:
			Values already computed at the kth iteration
		 	are also employed.

		 the intersection of a regular reticulum, non-directed
		 arcs.}
