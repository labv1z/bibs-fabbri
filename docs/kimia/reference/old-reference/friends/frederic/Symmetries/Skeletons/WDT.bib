  keywords =	{DT as an ``optimal policy problem''. Reticular
		 networks define a hierarchy of methods: method 0 =
		 city block metric; method 1 = Chamfer 1 - sqrt(2)
		 metric; method 2 = Chamfer 1 - sqrt(2) - sqrt(5)
		 metric; ... . Determination of optimal (minimal
		 length) paths trhough the network. Two types of
		 algorithms are proposed: "read" and "write" methods.
		 Useful links are determined by the Farey sequences of
		 order n (for a squared neighborhood of size 2n + 1).
		 The determination of the optimal policy == solution
		 of a system of functional eqns (dynamic programming).
		 On the reticular network, a minimal path between any
		 two distinct pts always consists of two straight line
		 segments.
		 The READ methods are similar to Chamfer DT's for
		 neighborhoods of increasing sizes. The ``read''
		 algorithm consists of a sequential raster scan in two
		 passes ``a la Rosenfeld'' \cite{Rosenfeld66Sequential}.
		 The WRITE method consists of a ``simplified Dantzig
		 algorithm''. Each vertex is considered only once.
		 Distances are computed by increasing order: similar
		 to a Discrete Wavefront Propagation. In the case of
		 method 0 it becomes a ``peeling off'' process.
		 SKELETAL pts are pixels not on the optimal path of
		 any other pixels (skeleton not necessarily
		 connected).
		 The INVERSE GRASSFIRE transformation is discussed and
		 an algorithm is proposed: iterative using the
		 ``read'' methods.
		 BRANCH SIGNIFICANCE criterion proposed in terms of
		 the (discrete) directional derivative along the
		 skeletal branch: -1 <= f_i < K <= 1, where f_i is the
		 approximated derivative and K is a threshold.
		 SPURIOUS SKELETAL PTS.
		 Along the image boundaries it is proposed to add an
		 external rectangular ``sausage'' of size n (for
		 method n) and compute a new skeleton S^*. Compare the
		 two skeletons S and S^*. At the locus of the original
		 boundaries only skeletal points both in S and S^* are
		 significant.
		 Along the object's boundary eliminate noise pts with
		 a severe enough threshold K on branch sigificance.}
