		  filters of receptive fields in processing curvature.
		 Result: High-spatial-frequency, orientation selective
		  mechanisms dominate curvature processing over the
		  entire range of curvature.
		 Low curvatures computations (hypothesis):
		  Processed by comparing the orientation selective
		  responses of high-frequency units displaced a fixed
		  distance (D) from the pt. of Max curvature.
		 2 processes underlie curvature discrimination:
		    (1) Pools responses of orientation selective units
		 	all centered at the same pt. on the contour
		 	--> estimate of local tangent (curvature).
		    (2) Low curvature computations by comparison of
		 	local high-frequency units.
		 Curvature processing is a counterexample to the
		  coarse-to-fine strategy that has been proposed for
		  disparity processing.
