		 reduce the total redundancy: number of sensors

		 pixels) and the amount of information represented by
		 the code is maintained constant; thus the total
		 entropy is left unchanged. However, the coding
		 proposed permits to convert higher-order redundancy
		 (high-order statistics or correlations between pairs,
		 triplets, etc., of pixels) into 1st-order redundancy
		 or statistics (response distribution of the
		 sensors). The next stage of processing could then
		 make efficient use of these 1st-order statistics by
		 coding only the nonredundant elements.}
