  abstract =	{We present a method for recovering the shape of a
		 single Lambertian surface, with unknown but uniform
		 reflectance, from a single RGB image of the object.
		 The method depends upon the linearity of the
		 relationship between RGB sensor responses and surface
		 normal directions that stems from the Lambertian
		 model. The algorithm follows closely upon work on the
		 photometric stereo method. However, that method
		 requires as input three separate black and white
		 intensity images, each taken separately, whereas the
		 method set out here needs only one color image. For
		 the method to succeed, the lighting color must vary
		 with direction from the surface. We test the method
		 by including three separate point light sources all
		 contributing to the illumination of the scene. The
		 method correctly recovers surface normals, up to an
		 overall orthogonal transformation.}
