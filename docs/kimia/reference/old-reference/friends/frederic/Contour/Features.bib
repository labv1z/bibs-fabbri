		 Region of support, and hence the corresponding scale

		  be determined independently, based on its local
		  properties.
		 The detection of dominant pts. relies not only on
		  the accuracy of measures of significance, but
		  primarily on the precise determination of the region
		  of support. This is contrary to the traditional
		  view in which accurate determination of discrete
		  curvature measures are believed essential.
		 Review of some algorithms: Rosenfeld--Johnston,
		  Rosenfeld--Wezska [Rosenfeld75], Freeman--Davis
		  [Freeman77], Sankar--Sharma [Sankar78] (see above).
		 Curvature measures (3 levels of significance):
			o k-cosine
			o 1-curvature
			o k-curvature
		 Determination of the region of support:
		      o Each boundary pt. should have its own view of
			of the curve. A dominant pt. should have a
			view constituting a meaningful region of support
			of the curve and should block the view from
			neighboring nondominant pts.
		      o Length of a chord: l_{ik} == distance between
			pts. p_{i-k} and p_{i+k}.
		      o Perpendicular distance: d_{ik} of the pt.
			p_{i} to the chord.
		      o Start with k = 1. Compute l_{ik} and d_{ik}
			until:	(a) l_{ik} >= l_{i,k+1} or
				(b) |d_{ik}|/l_{ik} >=
				     |d_{i,k+1}|/l_{i,k+1}
