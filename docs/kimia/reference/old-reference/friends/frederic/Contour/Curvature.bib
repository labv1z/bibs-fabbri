			o Moving from one process to another -->

		 Multi-curvature analysis:
			o Isolate parts at coarse scale and then repeat

			o However, preliminary results suggest that

			o Smoothing is needed to reduce digital noise
		 	  and to set the scale of the K extrema.
			o Convolution of the tangent histogram with
		 	  1st Derivative of a Gaussian.
			o Calculate the extent of the noisy region by
