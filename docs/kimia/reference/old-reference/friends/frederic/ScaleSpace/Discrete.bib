  keywords =	{1D Scale-Space Kernels:
		    (1)	Positivity and unimodality in the spatial
		 	domain. (p. 236)
		    (2)	Generating functions: generalized binomial
		 	kernels. (p. 237)
		    (3)	No real negative eigenvalues of the
		 	convolution (Toeplitz) matrix.
		    (4)	Positivity and unimodality in the frequency domain.
		    (5)	Convolution: decomposition into convolution
		 	with kernels having two strictly positive
		 	consecutive filter coefficients. (p.239)
		 1D Scale-Space Construction:
		    (1)	Use a continuous scale-space parameter to have
		 	a representation at any level of scale
		 	accessible. (p. 239)
		    (2)	Semigroup property required: T(.;s) * T(.;t) =
		 	T(.;s+t); ensures that the scale-space property
		  	holds between any 2 levels of scale. (p.240)
		    (3)	Theorem (uniqueness; in the discrete domain):
			One parameter family of symmetric functions
		 	satisfying the semigroup property and the
		 	normalization criterion: T(n;t) = exp(-at) In(at).
			Where In: modified Bessel functions of integer order.
		    (4)	Theorem (uniqueness; in the continuous domain):
			T(x;t) = Gaussian kernel. (p. 241)
		 1D Numerical Implementations:
		    (1)	Truncation: finite convolution sum.
		    (2)	Filter coefficient generation: recurrence
		 	relation + Miller's algorithm. (p. 242)
		    (3)	Perform the convolutions in the frequencey
		 	(Fourier) domain.
		 1D Numerical Approximations:
		    (1)	Sampled Gaussian kernel (p. 242)
			N.B.: transformation from a an arbitrary low
		 	level (t1) to an arbitrary high level (t2) is
		 	a scale-space transformation iff t1 = 0 or
	 		t1/t2 = odd integer. The semigroup property of
		 	the Gaussian kernel is not preserved after
		 	discretization.
		    (2)	Discretized diffusion equation:
			The discrete scale-space representation =
		 	solution of the system of diff. eqns obtained
		 	by discretizing the diffusion equ. in space and time. 
		 2D Discrete Scale-Space Formulation:
		    (1)	Local extrema should not be "enhanced" when
		 	the scale parameter is increased continuously
		 	= no new gray-level surfaces [isosurfaces z = z_o]
			should be created. (p. 244)
		   (1b) One cannot prevent the number of local extrema
		 	from ever being increased.
		 Key Sentences:
		    (1)	... convolution with a discrete scale-space
		 	kernel can really be regarded as a smoothing
		 	operation. (p. 236) 
		    (2)	... an operator which naively can be
		 	apprehended as a smoothing operator, might
		 	actually give a less smooth result. ... it can
		 	really matter if one averages over 3 instead
		 	of 2 points and how the averaging is
		 	performed. (p. 236)
		    (3)	... properties derived in the continuous case
		 	might be violated after discretization. (p. 242)
		    (4)	The natural way to apply the scale-space
		 	theory to discrete signals is apparently by
		 	discretization of the diffusion equ., not the
		 	convolution integral. (p. 242)
		    (5)	... it is possible to show that there does not
		 	exist any nontrivial kernel on R^2 or Z^2 with
		 	the property that it never introduces new local
			extrema. (p. 243)
		    (6)	In 1D the number of local extrema is a good
		 	measure of structure on which a theory can be
		 	founded -- in 2D obviously not.
		    (7)	... involved operators [sampled Gaussian
		 	kernels], which commute in the continuous
		 	domain, do not commute when the discretization
		 	operator is involved. (p. 247)
