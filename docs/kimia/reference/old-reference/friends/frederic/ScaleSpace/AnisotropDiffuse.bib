		 Criteria for scale-space:
			(1) Causality: no spurious details generated
		 		(from fine to coarse).
			(2) Immediate localization: sharp boundaries
		 		at each resolution should correspond
		 		to meaningful ones.
			(3) Piecewise smoothing: intraregion smoothing
		 		favored over interegion smoothing.
		 Anisotropic Diffusion:
			o I_t = div{c * nabla(I)} = c * grad(I) +
		 		nabla(c) * nabla(I)
			o Set the conduction coefficient, c, to be
		 	  non-constant: c = c(x,y,t).
			o Ideally: c = 1 in (identified) regions and
		 	  	   c = 0 at boundaries.
		 	o Practically: c = g(|| E ||);
				E = E(x,y,t): current estimate of a
		 		boundary (edges) location at scale t
		 		(e.g., E = nabla(I)).
				g(.): nonnegative monotonically
		 		decreasing function with g(0) = 1.
			o The anisotropic diffusion equ. < class of
		 	  elliptic eqns. that satisfy a Maximum
		 	  Principle (i.e., all max. & min. in the
		 	  scale-space belong to the original image and
		 	  the boundaries of the domain of interest).
			o Adiabatic boundary conditions (i.e., c = 0
		 	  at the image boundaries) ==> extrema only
		 	  belong to the original image.
