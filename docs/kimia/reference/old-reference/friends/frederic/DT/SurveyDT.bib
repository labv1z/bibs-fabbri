		 Time Complexities:
		 Sequential propagation (1 processor):
		  o Recursive raster-scan (C: O[n^2], NC: O[n^4])
		  o Data-dependent-scan   (C: O[n^2], NC: O[n^2])
		 Parallel propagation (n^2 processors):
		  o Full (1 proc./pixel)  (C: O[n], NC: O[n^2])
		  o Full pyramidal	  (C: O[Log(n)], NC: O[n^2])
		 Parallel propagation (m^2 processors; m << n):
		  o Window		  (C: O[n^3/m^2], NC: O[n^4/m^2])
		  o Window-recursive	  (C: O[n^2/m], NC: O[n^2+(n^4/m^3)])
		  o Distributed		  (C: O[n^3/m^2], NC: O[n^4/m^2])
		  o Distr.-recursive	  (C: O[n^2/m], NC: O[n^4/m^2])
		  o Distr.-parallel	  (C: O[(n^2/m^2)+m], NC: O[n^4/m^2])
		  o Distr.-para. (index)  (C: O[n^2/(m^2+n) * Log(n/m)],
					   NC: O[n^4/(m^4+n^2) * Log(n/m)])
		 Fastest propagation:
		  o Convex (thick) objects: Full pyramidal (O[Log(n)]).
		  o Convex (thin) objects:  Full parallel  (O[n]).
		  o Non-convex objects:	    No improvements with parallelism.}
