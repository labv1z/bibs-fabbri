		 Double-smoothing algorithm.
		 Properties of median filtering:
			o Median [a*x(n)] = a * Median [x(n)]
			  i.e., scaling of input leads to the scaling
		 		of the smoothed output.
			o Preserves sharp discontinuites (big enough).
			o Approximately follow polynomials.
			  --> The longer the running median, the more
		 	      it smoothes out lower order polynomials.
			o Superposition property of linear operators
		 	  does not hold.
