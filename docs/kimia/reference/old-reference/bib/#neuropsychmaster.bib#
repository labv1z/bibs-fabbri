		  must be able to specify the ways or respects in which two
		  things are similar. One solution to this problem is to
		  restrict the notion of similarity to hard-wired perceptual
		  processes. It is argued that this view is too narrow and
		  limiting. Instead, it is proposed that an important source
		  of constraints derives from the similarity comparison
		  process itself. Both new experiments and other evidence are
		  described that support the idea that respects are
		  determined by processes internal to comparisons."
