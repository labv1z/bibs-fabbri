Subject: Image/Text Separation (long)

Hi,
 Sometime back I requested for info on text and image separation in a document.
 I have got several responses and I would like to thank all for the responses.
 Some people have asked me to post the responses. The following list gives the
collection of papers on this topic. Hope, this will be of use to some out there.
