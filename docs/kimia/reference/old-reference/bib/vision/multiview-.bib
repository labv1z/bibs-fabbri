    Abstract\\
      Conics are widely accepted as one of the most fundamental image features together with points and line segments. The problem of space reconstruction and correspondence of two conics from two views is addressed in this paper. It is shown that there are two independent polynomial conditions on the corresponding pair of conics across two views, given the relative orientation of the two views. These two correspondence conditions are derived algebraically and one of them is shown to be fundamental in establishing the correspondences of conics. A unified closed-form solution is also developed for both projective reconstruction of conics in space from two uncalibrated camera views and metric reconstruction from two calibrated camera views. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the discriminality of the correspondence conditions and the accuracy and stability of the reconstruction both for simulated and real images

  abstract = {
 A multichannel feature-based stereo vision technique where curve segments are used as feature primitives in the matching process is described. The left image and the right image are filtered by using several Laplacian-of-Gaussian operators of different widths (channels). Curve segments are extracted by a tracking algorithm, and their centroids are obtained. At each channel, the generalized Hough transform of each curve segment in the left and the right image is evaluated. The epipolar constraint on the centroids of the curve segment and the channel size is used to limit the searching space in the right image. To resolve the ambiguity of the false targets (multiple matches), a relaxation technique is used where the initial scores of the node assignments are updated by the compatibility measures between the centroids of the curve segments. The node assignments with the highest score are chosen as the matching curve segments

   The topological obstacles to the matching of smooth curves in stereo images
     are shown to occur at epipolar tangencies. Matching is possible when these
     tangencies satisfy certain projective constraints (the tangent lines form
         corresponding pencils) and metric contraints dependent on the camera
     geometry. Such points are good matching primitives, even when the image
     curves correspond to smooth surface profiles. An iterative scheme for
     improving camera calibration based on these results is derived, and
     performance demonstrated on real data.},

   Abstract\\
 The paper surveys the developments of the last 10 years in the area of camera self-calibration. Self-calibration is an attempt to calibrate camera by finding intrinsic parameters that are consistent with the underlying projective geometry of a sequence of images. In order to solve this problem, the camera intrinsic constraints have been used separately and in conjunction with camera motion constraints or scene constraints. Most self-calibration algorithms are concerned with unknown but constant intrinsic camera parameters. Recently, camera self-calibration in the case of varying intrinsic camera parameters was also studied. We present the basic theories behind the different self-calibration techniques and discuss the ideas behind most of the self-calibration algorithms.

     Abstract\\
Well-known matching constraints for points and lines in muliple images are necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of real structure and cameras, underlying the image correspondences. To obtain sufficient conditions, the following additional constraints must be imposed: positive scales, the existence of a plane at infinity not intersecting the scene, and the existence of handedness preserving cameras. We present modifications of the well-known matching constraints and also some new constraints, taking into account some of this additional knowledge. Not only conventional but also central panoramic cameras are naturally described. To achieve this, we have generalized and simplified Hartley's ch(e)irality theory by formulating it in the language of oriented projective geometry and Grassmann tensors
