ABSTRACT="Our goal is to reconstruct both the shape and reflectance properties of surfaces from multiple images. We argue that an object-centered representation is most appropriate for this purpose becasue it naturally accomodates multiple sources of data, multiple images (including motion sequences of a rigid object), and self-occlusions. We then present a specific object-centered reconstruction method and its implementation. The method begins with an initial estimate of surface shape provided by triangulating the result of conventional stereo or other means. The surface shape and reflectance properties are then iteratively adjusted to minimize an objective function that combines information from multiple input images. The objective function is a weighted sum of ``Stereo,'' shading, and smoothness components, where the weight varies over the surface. For example, the stereo componenet is weighted more strongly where the surface projects onto highly textured areas in the images, and less strongly otherwise. Thus, each component has its greatest influence where its accuracy is likely to be greatest. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images are presented.",
