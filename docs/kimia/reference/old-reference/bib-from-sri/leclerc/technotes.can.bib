ABSTRACT="Our goal is to reconstruct both the shape and reflectance properties of surfaces from multiple images. We argue that an object-centered representation is most appropriate for this purpose becasue it naturally accomodates multiple sources of data, multiple images (including motion sequences of a rigid object), and self-occlusions. We then present a specific object-centered reconstruction method and its implementation. The method begins with an initial estimate of surface shape provided by triangulating the result of conventional stereo or other means. The surface shape and reflectance properties are then iteratively adjusted to minimize an objective function that combines information from multiple input images. The objective function is a weighted sum of ``Stereo,'' shading, and smoothness components, where the weight varies over the surface. For example, the stereo componenet is weighted more strongly where the surface projects onto highly textured areas in the images, and less strongly otherwise. Thus, each component has its greatest influence where its accuracy is likely to be greatest. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images are presented.",

ABSTRACT="Real world problems are rarely solved in one fell swoop. Rather, problem solving is an iterative process that involves acquiring and interpreting environmental information, then deciding what to do next. One alternative action might involve adjusting one's problem solving questions which a system must answer to find an acceptable solution. The desirability of pursuing such an alternative follows from the view that solving a problem often requires being able to identify and answer the ``right'' questions. In evidential reasoning (ER) systems, frames of discernments represent possible answers to the questions at hand. Asking a new question is equivalent to modifying an existing frame of discernment or constructing a new one, called ``reframing evidential problems'' here. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to deciding how to reframe problems based on minimizing an entropy characterization of the current situational knowledge. Currently, evidential knowledge-based systems (KDS) employ static frames; a user must modify frames if they are inadequate for the desired domain of application. Having some automated capability to make even simple adjustments to frames is expected to provide increased autonomy to KBS. An example of how the approach might be used in the domain of high-level computer vision is presented.",

We describe a fuzzy controller for such a mobile robot that can take multiple strategic goals into consideration.

While most competitors modified the environment in some way to simplify the problems of self-localization and object recognition, Flakey also distinguished itself through its ability to navigate gracefully while avoiding obstacles and people, employing techniques based on fuzzy logic.

ABSTRACT="The task of having computers able to understand their enviornments through direct imaging has proved to formidable. With its beginnings about 30 years ago, the field of computer vision has grown as a major part fot he pursuit for artificial intelligence. Most elements of this pursuit - language understanding, reasoning and planning, speech - are very difficult challenges, but vision, with its high dimensionality of space, time, scale, color,dynamics, and so forth, may be the most challenging. Early attempts to develop computer sivion focused on restricted situations in which it was feasible to provide the computer with fairly complete descriptions of what it would encounter. In such cases, single images provided the sensory information for analysis. As the domains of application grew, the requirements for more competent descriptions of the world increased. Dealing with three-dimensional (3D) dynamic structures (the real world) from 3D dynamic platforms (we humans) calls for greater capabilities on both the analysis and synthesis sides of the issue. The anlaysis side is the processing of sensory data for such tasks as recognition and navigation, and a number of techniques are discussed here for dealing with these two-, three-, and higher-dimensional data. The synthesis side is the construction of ``internal'' descriptions of what they may be used subsequently for the above tasks. This latter issue is the underlying theme we pose in this paper - developing representations from vision that will later enable effective automated operation in our 3D dynamic environments.",

ABSTRACT="Typical bottom-up, forward-chaining reasoning systems such as hyperresolution lack goal-directedness while typical top-down, backward-chaining reasoning systems like Prolog or model elimination repeatedly solve the same goals. Reasoning systems that are goal-directed and avoid repeatedly solving the same goals can be constructed by formulating the top-down methods metatheoretically for execution by a bottom-up reasoning system (hence, we use the term upside-down meta-interpretation). This formulation also facilitates the use of flexible search strategies, such as merit-ordered search that are common to bottom-up reasoning systems. The model elimination theorem-proving procedure, its extension by an assumption rule for abduction, and its restriction to Horn clauses are adapted here for such upside-down meta-interpretation. This work can be regarded as an extension of the magic-sets or Alexander method for query evaluation in deductive databases to both non-Horn clauses and abductive reasoning.",

ABSTRACT="Hybrid representation frameworks provide a powerful basis for constructing intelligent systems. Universal attachement is a domain-independent mechanism for integrating diverse representation and reasoning methods into hybrid frameworks that contain a subsystem based on deduction over logical formulas. Although based on the same principles as previous attachment methods, universal attachment provides a much broader range of connections between general-purpose deduction and specialized representation and reasoning techniques. This paper defines a formal inference rule of universal attachment and discusses the properties of soundness, completeness and correctness for this rule. The relationship between universal attachment and other integration techniques is explored. Finally, policies based on experimentation with an implemented universal attachment system are presented that lend guidance in exploiting the expanded representational and interential capabilities that hybrid systems provide.",

We call this system organization an open architecture. In our experience, several different classes of graph-based user interfaces exist. For example, one class produces static drawings of graphs, whereas another class requires extensive user interaction with graph drawings. The open architecture of Grasper-CL supports the development of all classes of interfaces, whereas previous graphers support only one or two classes of interfaces. Grasper-CL graphics operations are implemented using CLIM, the COMMON LISP Interface Manager.",

ABSTRACT="In the past 20 years, AI researchers in knowledge representation (KR) have implemented over 50 frame knowledge representation systems (FRSs). KR researchers have explored a large space of alternative FRS designs. This paper surveys the FRS design space in search of design principles for FRSs. The FRS design space is defined by the set of alternative features and capabilities -- such as the representational constructs -- that an FRS designer might choose to include in a particular FRS, as well as the alternative implementations that might exist for a particular feature. The paper surveys the architectural variations explored by different system designers for the frame, the slot, the knowledge base, for access-oriented programming, and for object-oriented programming. We find that few design principles exist to guide an FRS designer as to how particular design decisions will affect qualities of the resulting FRS, such as its worst-case and average-case theoretical complexity, its actual performance on real-world problems, the expressiveness and succinctness of the representation language, the runtime flexibility of the FRS, the modularity of the FRS, and the effort required to implement the FRS.",

ABSTRACT="FASTUS is a system for extracting information from free text in English, and potentially other languages as well, for entry into a database, and potentially for other applications. It works essentially as a cascaded, nondeterministic finite state automaton. There are four steps in the operation of FASTUS. In Step 1 sentences are scanned for certain trigger words to determine whether further processing should be done. In Step 2 noun groups, verb groups, and prepositions and some other particles are recognized. The input to Step 3 is the sequence of phrases recognized in Step 2; patterns of interest are identified in Step 3 and corresponding ``incident structures'' are built up. In Step 4 incident structures that derive from the same incident are identified and merged, and these are used in generating database entries. FASTUS is an order of magnitude faster than any comparable system; it can process a news report in an average of less than eleven seconds. This translates directly into fast development time. In the three and a half weeks between its first use and the MUC-4 evaluation in May 1992, we were able to build up its domain knowledge to a point where it was among the leaders in the evaluation.",

The theories I discuss are not restricted to how agents can form plans, but also concern the ways in which agents use their plans. Specifically, I describe the use of plans to guide action as well as to control reasoning and to enable inter-agent coordination. These uses of plans make possible intelligent behavior in complex, dynamic, multiagent environments.

ABSTRACT="The paper describes the basic syntactic rules in the Japanese Language Engine (JLE), a unification-based Japanese grammar used as part of a spoken Japanese interpretation system. The underlying assumption in this grammar is the Nondefeasibility Thesis --- the rules of grammar are nondefeasible, and all defeasible rules belong to pragmatics. In an overall understanding of an utterance in discourse, such a grammar module can have a meaningful functionality by giving each utterance a set of context-independent underspecified interpretations under the assumption that the module of pragmatic inferences is responsible for further elaborations of the interpretations. The JLE grammar developed with this perspective is robust and exception-free. The major syntactic phenomena of Japanese discussed include: argument omissibility, flexible word order, relativization, topicalization, and quantifier floating.",

Interactive capabilities include free-hand feature entry, altering features while constraining them to conform to the terrain and lighting geometry, adjustment of feature parameters, and the adjustment of the camera model to display the scene features from arbitrary viewpoints. Cartographic features are depictable either as wire-frame sketches for interactive purposes or as texture-mapped renderings for realistic scene synthesis. High-quality simulated scenes are created by texture-mapped images onto terrain data and adding renderings of cartographic features using depth-buffering and antialiasing techniques. Motion sequences can be created by choosing a series of camera models and rendering the simulated appearance of the scene from each viewpoint.",

ABSTRACT="Although graphics and direct manipulation are effective interface technologies for some classes of problems, they are limited in many ways. In particular, they provide little support for identifying objects not on the screen, for specifying temporal relations, for identifying and operating on large sets and subsets of entities and for using the context of interaction. On the other hand, these are precisely strengths of natural language. This paper presents an interface that blends natural language processing and direct manipulation technologies, using each for their characteristic advantages. Specifically, the paper shows how to use natural language to describe objects and temporal relations, and how to use direct manipulation for overcoming hard natural language problems involving the establishment and use of context and pronominal reference. This work has been implemented in SRI's Shoptalk system, a prototype information and decision-support system for manufacturing.",

ABSTRACT="It is often assumed that when natural language processing meets the real world, the idea of aiming for complete and correct interpretations has to be abandoned. However, our experience with TACITUS, especially in the MUC-3 evaluation, has shown that principled techniques for syntactic and pragmatic analysis can be bolstered with methods for achieving robustness. We describe and evaluate a method for dealing with unknown words and a method for filtering out sentences irrelevant to the task. We describe three techniques for making syntactic analysis more robust -- an agenda-based scheduling parser, a recovery technique for failed parses, and a new technique called terminal sub-string parsing. For pragmatics processing, we describe how the method of abductive inference is inherently robust, in that an interpretation is always possible, so that in the absence of the required world knowledge, performance degrades gracefully. Each of these techniques has been evaluated, and the results of the evaluations are presented.",

The fundamental ideas in the ``interpretation as abduction'' approach are outlined. A succinct characterization of interpretation is given, along with a brief example and a description of the principal features of a weighted abduction scheme that is used. The approach is shown to lead to an elegant integration of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Three examples of metaphor interpretation are then analyzed within the abductive framework to determine what problems arise. The examples are a conventionalized metaphor schema, a standard category metaphor contextually interpreted, and a novel metaphor. The primary problem that arises for metaphor interpretation in the abductive framework is dealing with the fact that metaphors are not literally true. Two perspectives on this difficulty are offered.",

ABSTRACT="A major limitation of graphical user interfaces for simulation is that users such as managers and decision makers need to know too much. We examine the weaknesses inherent in graphical user interfaces to support these users of simulation for short-term situation assessment and scenario evaluation, a style of problem solving characteristic of military and factory command-and-control. Then, we present Shoptalk, a factory command-and-control system with an interface integrating direct manipulation and natural-language processing and demonstrate how the Shoptalk style of interaction can overcome these limitations.",

ABSTRACT="There are two distinct formalizations for reasoning from observations to explanations, as in diagnostic tasks. The consistency based approach treats the task as a deductive one, in which the explanation is deduced from a background theory and a minimal set of abnormalities. In the other treatment, based on abduction, the explanations are considered to be sentences that, when added to the background theory, account for the observations. We show that there is a close connection between these two formalizations. Starting with a causal theory, explanations can be generated either by abductive reasoning, or by adding closure axioms and minimizing causation within a deductive framework. The latter method is strictly stronger than the former, but requires full knowledge of causation in a domain.",

ABSTRACT="What is involved when a group of agents decide to do something together? Joint action by a team appears to involve more than just the union of simultaneous individual actions, even when those actions are coordinated. We would not say that there is any teamwork involved in ordinary automobile traffic, even though the drivers act simultaneously and are coordinated (one hopes) by the traffic signs and rules of the road. But when a group of drivers decide to do something together, such as driving somewhere as a convoy, it appears that the group acts more like a single agent with beliefs, goals, and intentions of its own, over and above the individual ones. But given that actions are performed by individuals, and that it is individuals who ultimately have the beliefs and goals that engender action, what motivates agents to form teams and act together? In some cases, the answer is obviously the inherent value in doing something together, such as playing tennis, performing a duet, or dancing. These are examples of activities that simply cannot be performed alone. But in many cases, team activity is only one way among many of achieving the goals of the individuals. What benefits do agents expect to derive from their participation in a group effort? In this paper, we attempt to provide an answer to these questions. In particular, we argue that a joint activity is one that is performed by individuals sharing certain specific mental properties. We show how these properties affect and are affected by properties of the participants. Regarding the benefits of teamwork, we show that in return for the overhead involved in participating in a joint activity, an agent expects to be able to share the load in achieving a goal in a way that is robust against certain possible failures and misunderstandings.",

According to this approach, to construct a program meeting a given specification, we prove the existence of an object meeting the specified conditions. The proof is restricted to be sufficiently constructive, in the sense that, in establishing the existence of the desired output, the proof is forced to indicated a computational method for finding it. That method becomes the basis for a program that can be extracted from the proof. The exposition is based on the deductive-tableau system, a theorem-proving framework particularly suitable for program synthesis. The system includes a nonclausal resolution rule, facilities for reasoning about equality, an a well-founded induction rule.",

ABSTRACT="INTRODUCTION: Simpson's paradox exemplifies a class of problems that can arise when the logic used to reason about the semantics of propositional sentences does not adequately capture certain dependencies between sentences of interest. This paradox has been known as early as 1903 [YUL03], and has been discussed extensively in the statistical literature [SIM51, DAW79, BLY73, CHU42]. The phenomena that typically give rise to Simpson's paradox can occur in cases such as destructive testing (e.g., determining the breaking strength of materials in orthogonal directions), and identifying the composition of complex alloys. It has also been reported to occur in ``real-life'' several times since its discovery [KNA85, WAG82]. One such occurrence received wide attention in 1973 over the appearance of a sex bias in the admission policy for graduate students at the University of Berkeley [BIC75]. Given that automated systems will be expected to recognize and cope with the underlying phenomena of this paradox, it is important to develop effective methods for dealing with them, particularly as it impacts the choice of logics that systems must use to reason about real world problems. Only recently, however, has there been any significant indication that Simpson's paradox merits serious attention by the AI community [PEA88].",

ABSTRACT="This paper describes some recent research on architectures for situated (embedded) systems that need to deliberate and reason in real time. One of the most difficult problems in the design of such architectures is how to manage the reasoning performed by such a system while still meeting the real-time constraints of the problem domain. We present an architecture, based on the Procedural Reasoning System (PRS), that provides mechanisms for the management and control of deliberation and reasoning in real-time domains. In particular, we show how deliberation and reasoning strategies can be represented in the form of metalevel plans, and describe an interpreter that selects and executes these in a way that retains bounded reaction time. In addition, this approach allows us to represent different types of situated systems by varying the metalevel deliberation strategies. Finally, we provide some statistical measures of performance for one such type of situated system applied to a complex real-time application.",

ABSTRACT="Abduction is inference to the best explanation. In the TACITUS project at SRI we have developed an approach to abductive inference, called ``weighted abduction,'' that has resulted in a significant simplification of how the problem of interpreting texts is conceptualized. The interpretation of a text is the minimal explanation of why the text would be true. More precisely, to interpret a text, one must prove the logical form of the text from what is already mutually known, allowing for coercions, merging redundancies where possible, and making assumptions where necessary. It is shown how such ``local pragmatics'' problems as reference resolution, the interpretation of compound nominals, the resolution of syntactic ambiguity and metonymy, and schema recognition can be solved in this manner. Moreover, this approach of ``interpretation as abduction'' can be combined with the older view of ``parsing as deduction'' to produce an elegant and thorough integration of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, one that spans the range of linguistic phenomena from phonology to discourse structure and accommodates both interpretation and generation. Finally, we discuss means for making the abduction process efficient, possibilities for extending the approach to other pragmatics phenomena, and the semantics of the weights and costs in the abduction scheme.",

ABSTRACT="This research outlines the predominant dialogue and performance characteristics of three-person interpreted telephone speech during service-oriented dialogues, in comparison with those of two-person noninterpreted dialogues. An empirical study was conducted in which 12 native English speakers each made one telephone call through an experienced telephone interpreter to a Japanese confederate who did not speak English, and a second call to a Japanese confederate fluent in English. In total, 24 dialogues were collected, each one containing two successfully completed service tasks, or 48 tasks total. This paper reports on comparisons performed between three-person interpreted and two-person noninterpreted speech, based on the same pool of tasks and English subjects. The unique characteristics of interpreted telephone dialogues are outlined, including structural and referential features, miscommunications and other performance characteristics, confirmatory language, and linguistic indirection. In addition, an analysis is presented of interpreters' strategic management of turn shifts, and of the content, sequencing, and chunking of information passed among speakers. The long-term goal of this exploratory research is the modeling of human speech, and the specification of preliminary target requirements for future automatic systems.",

ABSTRACT="Rule-based systems are being applied to tasks of increasing responsibility. Deductive methods are being applied to their validation, to detect flaws in these systems and enable us to use them with more confidence. Each system of rules is encoded as a set of axioms that define the system theory. The operation of the rule language and information about the subject domain are also described in the system theory. Validation tasks, such as establishing termination, unreachability, or consistency, or verifying properties of the system, are all phrased as conjectures. If we succeed in establishing the validity of the conjecture in the system theory, we have carried out the corresponding validation task. A method for the gradual formulation of specifications based on the attempted proof of a series of conjectures has been found to be suitable for rule-based systems. Such a specification can serve as the basis for a reengineering of the system using conventional software technology.",

ABSTRACT="CONCLUSION: One of the primary advantages of the treatment of syntactic constraints on anaphoric binding that has been presented here is that it provides a framework for stating binding constraints in a precise manner. The framework makes explicit predictions as to which noun phrases will be considered when anaphoric binding constraints are applied. In this sense, anaphoric binding constraints are different from relations of conference. If two elements are coreferent, this may satisfy some positive constraint or violate some negative constraint; coreference between the two might also be irrelevant to any binding constraint. These cases can be easily distinguished in this framework. Stating constraints in terms of binding equations makes it easy to express interactions between binding constraints; such interactions are even predicted in some cases. In the absence of such a framework, it is difficult even to frame the question of what interactions can occur; given an explicit statement of the binding constraints, such interactions are easy to observe.",

ABSTRACT="This note presents a personal view of the state of the art in the representation and manipulation of imprecise and uncertain information by automated processing systems. To contrast their objectives and characteristics with the sound deductive procedures of classical logic, methodologies developed for that purpose are usually described as relying on Approximate Reasoning. Using a unified descriptive framework, we will argue that, far from being mere approximations of logically correct procedures, approximate reasoning methods are also sound techniques that describe the properties of a set of conceivable states of a real-world system. This framework, which is based on the logical notion of possible worlds, permits the description of the various approximate reasoning methods and techniques and simplifies their comparison. More importantly, our descriptive model facilitates the understanding of the fundamental conceptual characteristics of the major methodologies. We examine first the development of approximate reasoning methods from early advances to the present state of the art, commenting also on the technical motivation for the introduction of certain controversial approaches. Our unifying semantic model is then introduced to explain the formal concepts and structures of the major approximate reasoning methodologies: classical probability calculus, the Dempster-Shafer calculus of evidence, and fuzzy (possibilistic) logic. In particular, we discuss the basic conceptual differences between probabilistic and possibilistic approaches. Finally, we take a critical look at the controversy about the need and utility for diverse methodologies, and assess requirements for future research and development.",

ABSTRACT="We present a system for the incremental interpretation of natural-language utterances in context. The main goal of the work is to account for the influences of context on interpretation, while preserving compositionality to the extent possible. To achieve this goal, we introduce a representational device, conditional interpretations, and a rule system for constructing them. Conditional interpretations represent the potential contributions of phrases to the interpretation of an utterance. The rules specify how phrase interpretations are combined and how they are elaborated with respect to context. The control structure defined by the rules determines the points in the interpretation process at which sufficient information becomes available to carry out specific inferential interpretation steps, such as determining the plausibility of particular referential connections or modifier attachments. We have implemented these ideas in Candide, a system for interactive acquisition of procedural knowledge.",

Both the agent and the environment are highly parameterized, enabling one to control certain characteristics of each. We can thus experimentally investigate the behavior of various meta-level reasoning strategies by tuning the parameters of the agent, and can assess the success of alternative strategies in different environments by tuning the environmental parameters. Our hypothesis is that the appropriateness of a particular meta-level reasoning strategy will depend in large part upon the characteristics of the environment in which the agent incorporating that strategy is situated. We describe our initial experiments using Tileworld, in which we have been evaluating a version of the meta-level reasoning strategy proposed in earlier work by one of the authors [Bratman et al., 1988].",

In addition, it has been tested on a number of sentences of linguistic interest. Built into the system are facilities for ranking parses according to syntactic and selectional considerations, and over the years, as various kinds of ambiguity have become apparent, heuristics have been devised for choosing the preferred parses. Our aims in this paper is first to present a compendium of many of these heuristics and secondly to propose two principles that seem to underlie the heuristics. The first aim will be useful to researchers engaged in building grammars of similarly broad coverage. The second is of psychological interest and may be a guide for estimating parse preferences for newly discovered ambiguities for which we lack the experience to decide among on a more empirical basis.",

ABSTRACT="The integration of information is a central issue for Artificial Intelligence research and development. The inference process in AI is the fundamental mechanism for combining information, and a significant aspect of most AI systems is the means by which they manage their overall workload by focusing processing attention and controlling which inferences are drawn and when it is appropriate to draw them. Several perspectives on the control of inferential processes and their access to information have evolved. One view of the problem treats the task as a goal-driven perceptual process, where specific information is explicitly sought from the world through selected sensor modalities, translated into a common ``vocabulary,'' fused with other relevant information, and finally translated back into an understanding of critical aspects of the environment. Another view, centers on a flexible structure known as the blackboard architecture for enforcing control and communication activities. In this paper, we first review briefly a variety of AI inference techniques, focusing primarily on logical inference and uncertain reasoning methods. We conclude with a survey of approaches used to control inference processes, to mediate their access to real world information, and to schedule their activities.",

ABSTRACT="The development of reasoning systems that can reason and plan in a continuously changing environment is emerging as an important area of research in Artificial Intelligence. This paper describes some of the features of a Procedural Reasoning System (PRS) that enables it to operate effectively in such environments. The basic system design is first described and it is shown how this architecture supports both goal-directed reasoning and the ability to react rapidly to unanticipated changes in the environment. The decision-making capabilities of the system are then discussed and it is indicated how the system integrates these components in a manner that takes account of the bounds on both resources and knowledge that typify most real-time operations. The system has been applied to handling malfunctions on the space shuttle, threat assessment, and the control of an autonomous robot.",

ABSTRACT="This paper describes research concerned with automating the monitoring and control of spacecraft systems. In particular, the paper examines the application of SRI's Procedural Reasoning System (PRS) to the handling of malfunctions in the Reaction Control System (RCS) of NASA's space shuttle. Unlike traditional monitoring and control systems, PRS is able to reason about and perform complex tasks in a very flexible and robust manner, somewhat in the manner of a human assistant. Using various RCS malfunctions as examples (including sensor faults, leaking components, multiple alarms, and regulator and jet failures), it is shown how PRS manages to combine both goal-directed reasoning and the ability to react rapidly to unanticipated changes in its environment. In conclusion, some important issues in the design of PRS are reviewed and future enhancements are indicated.",

ABSTRACT="In this report, we describe the search algorithm of the GEMPLAN multiagent planning system. The search algorithm is based upon the GEMPLAN domain description and its localized constraint representation. The problem domain is structured into regions of activity, and each region has its own set of local constraints. The search is a constraint-satisfaction process; it tries to find a plan in each region by satisfying the region's constraints. Therefore, the search space is subdivided into regional search trees. Unfortunately, these search trees cannot be searched independently. However, the situation is much better than global search because GEMPLAN's constraint localization, together with the domain structure, precisely define when the search in one region can affect another region, and hence how control must shift from one search tree to another. To avoid any confusion, this report does not describe GEMPLAN, but only its generic localized search algorithm. We only explain and abstract features of GEMPLAN on which this search algorithm is based. As a result, this algorithm is applicable to any other constraint-satisfaction problem with characteristics similar to GEMPLAN.",

ABSTRACT="This note presents a formal semantic characterization of the major concepts and constructs of fuzzy logic in terms of notions of distance, closeness, and similarity between pairs of possible worlds. The formalism is a direct extension (by recognition of multiple degrees of accessibility, conceivability, or reachability) of the major modal logic concepts of possible and necessary truth. Given a function that maps pairs of possible worlds into a number between 0 and 1, generalizing the conventional concept of an equivalence relation, the major constructs of fuzzy logic (i.e., conditioned and uncondition possibility distributions) are defined in terms of this generalized similarity relation using familiar concepts from the mathematical theory of metric spaces. This interpretation is different in nature and character from the typical, chance-oriented, meanings associated with probabilistic concepts, which are grounded on the mathematical notion of set measure. The similarity structure defines a topological notion of continuity in the space of possible worlds (and in that of its subsets, i.e., propositions) that allow a form of logical ``extrapolation'' between possible worlds. This logical extrapolation operation corresponds to the major deductive rule of fuzzy logic ---the compositional rule of inference or generalized modus ponens of Zadeh---an inferential operation that generalizes its classical counterpart by virtue of its ability to be utilized when propositions representing available evidence only match approximately the antecedents of conditional propositions. The relations between the similarity-based interpretation of the role of conditional possibility distributions and the approximate inferential procedures of Baldwin are also discussed. A straightforward extension of the theory to the case where the similarity scale is symbolic rather than numeric is described. The problem of generating similarity functions from a given set of possibility distributions, with the latter interpreted as defining a number of (graded) discernibility relations and the former as the result of combining them into a joint measure of distinguishability between possible worlds, is briefly discussed.",

ABSTRACT="A primary motivation for reasoning under uncertainty is to derive decisions in the face of inconclusive evidence. Shafer's theory of belief functions, which explicitly represents the underconstrained nature of many reasoning problems, lacks a formal procedure for making decisions. Clearly, when sufficient information is not available, no theory can prescribe actions without making additional assumptions. Faced with this situation, some assumption must be made if a clearly superior choice is to emerge. In this paper we offer a probabilistic interpretation of a simple assumption that disambiguates decision problems represented with belief functions. We prove that it yields expected values identical to those obtained by a probabilistic analysis that makes the same assumption. We maintain a strict separation between evidence that carries information about a situation and assumptions that may be made for disambiguation of choices. In addition, we show how the decision analysis methodology frequently employed in probabilistic reasoning can be extended for use with belief functions. This generalization of decision analysis allows the use of belief functions within the familiar framework of decision trees.",

ABSTRACT="There exists a large body of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research on generating plans, i.e., linear or nonlinear sequences of actions, to transform an initial world state to some desired goal state. However, much of the planning research to date has been complicated, ill-understood, and unclear. Only a few of the developers of these planners have provided a thorough description of their research products, and those descriptions that exist are usually unrealistically favorable since the range of applications for which the systems are tested is limited to those for which they were developed. As a result, it is difficult to evaluate these planners and to choose the best planner for a different domain. To make a planner applicable to different planning problems, it should be domain independent. However, one needs to know the circumstances under which a general planner works so that one can determine its suitability for a specific domain. This paper presents criteria for evaluating AI planners; these criteria fall into three categories: (1) performance issues, (2) representational issues, and (3) communication issues. This paper also assesses four nonlinear AI planners (NOAH, NONLIN, SIPE, and TWEAK).",

Using multiresolution parallel relaxation, we can efficiently compute the interpolated surface and also have local control over its continuity and smoothness. We apply this technique to sparse elevation data and to elevation contours, and show how to add realistic fractal detail through stochastic relaxation. We also present a multiresolution decomposition algorithm and a fast parallel 3-D rendering algorithm.",

ABSTRACT="A Prolog technology theorem prover (PTTP) is an extension of Prolog that is complete for the full first-order predicate calculus. It differs from Prolog in its use of unification with the occurs check for soundness, depth-first iterative-deepening search instead of unbounded depth-first search to make the search strategy complete, and the model elimination reduction rule that is added to Prolog inferences to make the inference system complete. This paper describes a new Prolog-based implementation of PTTP. It uses three compile-time transformations to translate formulas into Prolog clauses that directly execute, with the support of a few run-time predicates, the model elimination procedure with depth-first iterative-deepening search and unification with the occurs check. Its high performance exceeds that of Prolog-based PTTP interpreters, and it is more concise and readable than the earlier Lisp-based compiler, which makes it superior for expository purposes. Examples of inputs and outputs of the compile-time transformations provide an easy and quite precise way to explain how PTTP works. This Prolog-based version makes it easier to incorporate PTTP theorem-proving ideas into Prolog programs. Some suggestions are made on extensions to Prolog that could be used to improve PTTP's performance.",

ABSTRACT="Computational and theoretical linguists and computer scientists interested in the computer processing of natural language have converged on a class of grammar formalisms for describing the well-formedness conditions of natural languages. This class is distinguished by its reliance on systems of declarative constraints to explicate natural-language syntax axiomatically, rather than generatively or procedurally. Intuition suggests that these various efforts from a broad range of disciplines form a natural methodological class; still, there is no general foundation on which to ground this impression. We provide a method for abstractly and uniformly characterizing a class of formalisms based on logical constraints, and use the uniformity to define and prove correct a parsing algorithm that applies to any formalism in the class. We discuss the applicability of these techniques to computer languages as well, specifically to type inference. In so doing, extensions of the simple formalism instances typically considered in natural-language analysis are motivated. This dissertation thus provides a mathematical and computational foundation for, and extensions of, current practices in theoretical and computational linguistics, as well as initiating a rapprochement between the techniques for describing well-formedness of natural and computer languages.",

ABSTRACT="A representation paradigm for instantiating and refining multiple, concurrent descriptions of an object from a sequence of imagery is presented. This paradigm is designed to be used by the perception system of an autonomous robot that $1$) needs to describe many types of objects, $2$) initially detects objects at a distance and gradually acquires higher resolution data, and $3$) continuously collects sensory input. We argue that multiple, concurrent descriptions of an object are necessary because different perceptual tasks are best performed using different representations and because different types of descriptions require different quality data to support their computation. Since the data change significantly over time, the paradigm supports the evolution of descriptions, progressing from crude $2$-D ``blob'' descriptions to complete semantic models, such as bush, rock, and tree. To control this accumulation of new descriptions, we introduce the idea of{\em representation space}. Representation space is a lattice of representations that specifies the order in which they should be considered for describing an object. Each of the representations in the lattice is associated with an object only after the object has been described multiple times in the representation and the parameters of the representation have been judged to be ``stable''. We define stability in a statistical sense, enhanced by a set of explanations describing valid reasons for deviations from expected measurements. These explanations may draw on many types of knowledge, including the physics of the sensor, the performance of the segmentation procedure, and the reliability of the matching technique. To illustrate the power of these ideas, we have implemented a system, which we call TraX, that constructs and refines models of outdoor objects detected in sequences of range data.",

ABSTRACT="One of the central issues to be addressed in basing a theory of speech acts on independently motivated accounts of propositional attitudes (belief, knowledge, intentions, etc.) and action is the specification of the effects of communicative acts. The very fact that speech acts are conventional means that specifying the effects of the utterance of, say, a declarative sentence, or the performance of an assertion, requires taking into consideration many possible deviations from the conventional use of sentences --- specifically uses that are insincere, not serious, or indirect. Previous approaches to the problem of specifying speech act consequences have paid insufficient attention to the dependence of the participants' mental state after an utterance on their mental state preceding it. We present a limited solution to the problem of belief revision within Reiter's nonmonotonic Default Logic and show how to formulate the consequences of many uses of declarative sentences. Default rules are used to embody a simple theory of belief adoption, action observation, and the relation between the form of a sentence and the attitudes it is used to convey.",

The present study examined two speech modalities that represent opposites on the spectrum of speaker interaction --- the telephone dialogue and audiotape monologue. Experts provided instructions by either telephone or audiotape as their novice partner completed an assembly task. Within this task framework, a comprehensive analysis is provided of the basic differences in discourse organization, referential characteristics, and performance efficiency for these two spoken modalities. The outlined distinctions are interpreted with special reference to the role of confirmation feedback in promoting dialogue efficiency. Implications are discussed for the development of prospective speech systems designed to be habitable, high quality, and relatively enduring. Finally, a theoretical model of collaborative dialogue is proposed from which several features of interactive and noninteractive speech can be derived.",

ABSTRACT="Communication channels physically constrain the flow and shape of human language just as irresistably as a river bed directs the river's current. Escarpments speed the current, sculpting jetties and whirlpools. Meadows encourage evenness, a certain recumbency. The flow becomes a deafening cascade as it passes over grainte bolders, and is arrested abruptly behind man-made dams. In short, the river is molded, rendered navigable or not, through the physical medium of its own bed. Although the communication modalities may be less visually compelling than the terrain surrounding a river, it is a mistake to assume that they are any less influential in shaping the language transmitted within them. Understanding the influence of communication modalities begins with an identification of their landmark features, and of the observable impact of these features on language. One goal of this chapter is to provide a comparison of the discourse and performance characteristics of instructions presented in three different modalities, each of which was classified according to the presence or absence of: 1) speech and 2) interaction. A second goal is to begin constructing an analytical framework from which predictions can be made about the separate impact of speech and interaction on specific aspects of discourse and performance.",

ABSTRACT="By determining what added assumptions would suffice to make the logical form of a sentence in natural language provable, abductive inference can be used in the interpretation of sentences to determine what information should be added to the listener's knowledge, i.e., what he should learn from the sentence. This is a comparatively new application of mechanized abduction. A new form of abduction---least specific abduction---is proposed as being more appropriate to the task of interpreting natural language than the forms that have been used in the traditional diagnostic and design-synthesis applications of abduction. The assignment of numerical costs to axioms and assumable literals permits specification of preferences on different abductive explanations. A new Prolog-like inference system that computes abductive explanations and their costs is given. To facilitate the computation of minimum-cost explanations, the inference system, unlike others such as Prolog, is designed to avoid the repeated use of the same instance of an axiom or assumption.",

ABSTRACT="Nonmonotonic logics are meant to be a formalization of nonmonotonic reasoning. However, for the most part they fail to embody two of the most important aspects of such reasoning: the explicit computational nature of nonmonotonic inference, and the assignment of preferences among competing inferences. We propose a method of nonmonotonic reasoning in which the notion of inference from specific bodies of evidence plays a fundamental role. The formalization is based on autoepistemic logic, but introduces additional structure, a hierarchy of evidential spaces. The method offers a natural formalization of many different applications of nonmonotonic reasoning, including reasoning about action, speech acts, belief revision, and various situations involving competing defaults.",

ABSTRACT="SRI's KNIFE image analysis system can be used for tracking objects and material classes from one image to another. Variations on this theme are the initial acquisition of target instances from database signatures and the subsequent acquisition of additional instances in an image once a few objects have been labeled. Classification-based tracking is facilitated by improved color and texture-energy transforms. KNIFE's labeling and partitioning methods can be used with complex targets, and are relatively unaffected by occlusions and changes in object appearance during tracking.",

ABSTRACT="The KNIFE segmentation algorithm interleaves splitting and merging of regions during mono\-chrome or multiband image partitioning. KNIFE splits regions along object boundaries, thus avoiding rectangular quadtree artifacts and establishing a context for good statistical decisions. Its iterative subregion extraction is based on multiband cluster analysis, with histogram-based threshold analysis used as a heuristic shortcut in simple cases. Splitting and merging decisions are based on sloped (rather than constant) surface fits, with successively more powerful thresholds and techniques employed until each region is split or found homogeneous. The user specifies only a desired level of segmentation, which is converted to procedural form by the KNIFE control process. The KNIFE package also offers a region-growing algorithm based on recursive splitting of neighboring regions. Examples of the two techniques are given for the domains of aerial cartography and reconnaissance, target cuing, and navigational vision.",

A comprehensive, ecologically oriented description of brokering is provided that focuses on its structure, functions, and the communicative factors associated with its use. In addition, analyses are provided of three types of disruptive miscommunication that predominate during Japanese--English interpretation, along with the brokering techniques that interpreters use to resolve them effectively. Implications of these research findings for the design of an automatic Japanese--English telephone interpretation system are discussed. It is argued that such a system would benefit from incorporation of a brokered approach to interpretation that is based on adequate recognition of a speaker's intentions.",

ABSTRACT="The use of a single grammar for both parsing and generation is an idea with a certain elegance, the desirability of which several researchers have noted. In this paper, we discuss a more radical possibility: not only can a single grammar be used by different processes engaged in various ``directions'' of processing, but one and the same language-processing architecture can be used for processing the grammar in the various modes. In particular, parsing and generation can be viewed as two processes engaged in by a single parameterized theorem prover for the logical interpretation of the formalism. We discuss our current implementation of such an architecture, which is parameterized in such a way that it can be used for either purpose with grammars written in the PATR formalism. Furthermore, the architecture allows fine tuning to reflect different processing strategies, including parsing models intended to mimic psycholinguistic phenomena. This tuning allows the parsing system to operate within the same realm of efficiency as previous architectures for parsing alone, but with much greater flexibility for engaging in other processing regimes.",

ABSTRACT="This paper derives the basis of a theory of communication from a formal theory of rational interaction. The major result is a demonstration that illocutionary acts need neither be primitive, nor explicitly recognized. As a test case, we derive Searle's conditions on requesting from principles of rationality coupled with a theory of imperatives. The theory rests on a formal account of intention and distinguishes insincere or nonserious imperatives from true requests. A theory of purposeful communication thus emerges as a consequence of principles of action and interaction.",

YEAR=1988,
ABSTRACT="A prerequisite to a theory of the way agents understand speech acts is a theory of how their beliefs and intentions are revised as a consequence of events. This process of attitude revision is an interesting domain for the application of nonmonotonic reasoning because speech acts have a conventional aspect that is readily represented by defaults, but that interacts with an agent's beliefs and intentions in many complex ways that may override the defaults. Perrault has developed a theory of speech acts, based on Reiter's default logic, that captures the conventional aspect; it does not, however, adequately account for certain easily observed facts about attitude revision resulting from speech acts. A natural theory of attitude revision seems to require a method of stating preferences among competing defaults. We present here a speech act theory, formalized in hierarchic autoepistemic logic (a refinement of Moore's autoepistemic logic), in which revision of both the speaker's and hearer's attitudes can be adequately described. As a collateral benefit, efficient automatic reasoning methods for the formalism exist. The theory has been implemented and is now being employed by an utterance-planning system.",

In this paper we review the process whereby other expert system technologies produce explanations, and present a methodology for augmenting an evidential-reasoning system with a versatile explanation facility. The method, which is based on sensitivity analysis, has been implemented, and several examples of its use are described.",

ABSTRACT="This paper presents the {\bf GEM} concurrency model and {\bf GEMPLAN}, a multiagent planner based on this model. Unlike standard state-based AI representations, GEM is unique in its explicit emphasis on events and domain structure. In particular, a world domain is modeled as a {\it set of regions composed of interrelated events.} Event-based temporal logic constraints are then associated with each region to delimit legal domain behavior. The GEMPLAN planner directly reflects this emphasis on domain structure and constraints. It can be viewed as a general-purpose constraint satisfaction facility which constructs a network of interrelated events (a ``plan'') that is subdivided into regions (``subplans''), satisfies all applicable regional constraints, and also achieves some stated goal. Because GEMPLAN is specifically geared towards parallel, multiagent domains, we believe that its natural application areas will include scheduling and other forms of organizational coordination. GEMPLAN extends and generalizes previous planning architectures in several ways. First of all, it can handle a much broader range of constraint forms than most planners. Second, GEMPLAN's constraint satisfaction search strategy can be flexibly tuned. A third and critical aspect of our work has been an emphasis on {\it localized} reasoning --- techniques that make explicit use of domain structure. For example, GEM localizes the applicability of domain constraints and imposes additional ``locality constraints'' on the basis of domain structure. Together, constraint localization and locality constraints provide semantic information that can be used to alleviate several aspects of the frame problem for multiagent domains. The GEMPLAN planner reflects this use of locality by subdividing its constraint satisfaction search space into {\it regional planning search spaces}. Utilizing constraint and property localization, GEMPLAN can pinpoint and rectify interactions among these regional search spaces, thus reducing the burden of ``interaction analysis'' ubiquitous to most planning systems.",

Several such reductions are informally discussed, and one, a reduction from the formalism used in work on generalized phrase-structure grammar to the PATR-II formalism is presented in more detail.",

ABSTRACT="Over the past five years the Artificial Intelligence Center at SRI has been developing a new technology to address the problem of automated information management within real-world contexts. The result of this work is a body of techniques for automated reasoning from evidence that we call {\em evidential reasoning.} The techniques are based upon the mathematics of belief functions developed by Dempster and Shafer and have been successfully applied to a variety of problems including computer vision, multisensor integration, and intelligence analysis. We have developed both a formal basis and a framework for implementing automated reasoning systems based upon these techniques. Both the formal and practical approach can be divided into four parts: (1)~specifying a set of distinct propositional spaces, (2)~specifying the interrelationships among these spaces, (3)~representing bodies of evidence as belief distributions, and (4)~establishing paths for the bodies of evidence to move through these spaces by means of evidential operations, eventually converging on spaces where the target questions can be answered. These steps specify a means for arguing from multiple bodies of evidence toward a particular (probabilistic) conclusion. Argument construction is the process by which such evidential analyses are constructed and is the analogue of constructing proof trees in a logical context. This technology features the ability to reason from uncertain, incomplete, and occasionally inaccurate information based upon seven evidential operations: fusion, discounting, translating, projection, summarization, interpretation, and gisting. These operations are theoretically sound but have intuitive appeal as well. In implementing this formal approach, we have found that evidential arguments can be represented as graphs. To support the construction, modification, and interrogation of evidential arguments, we have developed Gister. Gister provides an interactive, menu-driven, graphical interface that allows these graphical structures to be easily manipulated. Our goal is to provide effective automated aids to domain experts for argument construction. Gister represents our first attempt at such an aid.",

ABSTRACT="This paper explores principles governing the rational balance among an agent's beliefs, goals, actions, and intentions. Such principles provide specifications for artificial agents, and approximate a theory of human action (as philosophers use the term). By making explicit the conditions under which an agent can drop his goals, i.e., by specifying how the agent is committed to his goals, the formalism captures a number of important properties of intention. Specifically, the formalism provides analyses for Bratman's three characteristic functional roles played by intentions [7,8], and shows how agents can avoid intending all the foreseen side-effects of what they actually intend. Finally, the analysis shows how intentions can be adopted relative to a background of relevant beliefs and other intentions or goals. By relativizing one agent's intentions in terms of beliefs about another agent's intentions (or beliefs), we derive a preliminary account of interpersonal commitments.",

The Hamiltonian used in the original model is minimized, but far more efficiently. The basis of microcanonical annealing is the Creutz algorithm . Unlike its counterpart, the familiar Metropolis algorithm, the Creutz algorithm simulates a thermally isolated system at equilibrium. The hierarchical control structure, together with a Brownian state-transition function, tracks ground states across scale, beginning with small, coarsely coded levels.

In this paper, we apply the correlational definition of knowledge to machines with composite structure and describe the semantics of knowledge representations in terms of correlation-based denotation functions. In particular, we describe how epistemic properties of synchronous digital machines can be analyzed, starting at the level of gates and delays, by modeling the machine's components as agents in a multiagent system and reasoning about the flow of information among them. We also introduce Rex, a language for computing machine descriptions recursively, and explain how it can be used to construct machines with provable informational properties.",

In this paper, a formalism is presented for representing such knowledge using the notion of {\it process}. A declarative semantics for the representation is given, which allows a user to state {\it facts} about the effects of doing things in the problem domain of interest. An operational semantics is also provided, which shows {\it how} this knowledge can be used to achieve particular goals or to form intentions regarding their achievement. Given both semantics, our formalism additionally serves as an executable specification language suitable for constructing complex systems.

The SIPE planning system retains the efficiency of the STRIPS assumption for this while enhancing expressive power by allowing the specification of a causal theory.

ABSTRACT="In this paper we present a theory of referring. This theory is presented within the framework of a general theory of speech acts and rationality advanced by Cohen and Levesque. Understanding a speech act involves two tasks on the part of the hearer: recognition of the {\it literal goal}, and recognition and satisfaction of {\it identification constraints}. We present a theory in which it is possible to demonstrate that, if a referring expression is uttered under appropriate circumstances, the literal goal is achieved. Furthermore, the same theory can account for the fact that referring expressions can be used under other circumstances to inform and make requests. This theory has application to the design of a natural-language utterance planning system that formulates utterances to achieve its goals.",

ABSTRACT="The approach proposed by Carnap for the development of logical bases for probability theory is investigated by using formal structures that are based on epistemic logics. Epistemic logics are modal logics introduced to deal with issues that are relevant to the state of knowledge that rational agents have about the real world. The use of epistemic logics in problems of analysis of evidence is justified by the need to distinguish among such notions as the state of a real system, the state of knowledge possessed by rational agents, and the impact of information on that knowledge. Carnap's method for generating a universe of possible worlds is followed using an enhanced notion of possible world that encompasses descriptions of knowledge states. Within such generalized or {\em epistemic} universes, several classes of sets are identified in terms of the truth-values of propositions that describe either the state of the world or the state of knowledge about it. These classes of subsets have the structure of a sigma algebra. Probabilities defined over one of these sigma algebras, called the {\em epistemic algebra,} are then shown to have the properties of the belief and basic probability assignment functions of the Dempster-Shafer calculus of evidence. It is also shown that any extensions of a probability function defined on the epistemic algebra (representing different states of knowledge) to the {\em truth algebra} (representing true states of the real world) must satisfy the interval probability bounds derived from the Dempster-Shafer theory. These bounds are also shown to correspond to the classical notions of lower and upper probability. Furthermore, these constraints are shown to be the best possible bounds, given a specific state of knowledge. Finally, the problem of combining the knowledge that several agents have about a real-world system is addressed. Structures representing possible results of the integration of that knowledge are introduced and a general formula for the combination of evidence is derived. From this formula and certain probabilistic independence assumptions, a generalization of the rule of combination of Dempster is readily proved. The meaning of these independence assumptions is made explicit through the insight provided by the formal structures that are used to represent knowledge and truth. Finally, simple cases of combination of dependent evidence are discussed as an introduction to more general problems of general combination that are examined in a related paper.",

ABSTRACT="Default logic is a formal means of reasoning about defaults: what normally is the case, in the absence of contradicting information. Autoepistemic logic, on the other hand, is meant to describe the consequences of reasoning about ignorance: what must be true if a certain fact is not known. Although the motivation and formal character of these two systems are different, a closer analysis shows that they share a common trait, which is the indexical nature of certain elements in the theory. In this paper we compare the expressive power of the two systems. First, we give an effective translation of default logic into autoepistemic logic; default theories can thus be embedded into autoepistemic logic. We also present a more surprising result: the reverse translation is also possible, so that every set of sentences in autoepistemic logic can be effectively rewritten as a default theory. The formal equivalence of these two differing systems is thus established. This analysis gives an interpretive semantics to default logic, and yields insight into the nature of defaults in autoepistemic reasoning.",

ABSTRACT="To have a general-purpose machine vision capability, we must be able to recognize things; we argue that most natural objects have a {\em part structure} that we can recover from image data and thus use as the basis for ``general-purpose'' recognition. We describe a ``parts'' representation that is fairly general purpose, despite having only a small number of parameters. Having this expressive power captured by a small number of parameters allows us to approach the problem of recovering an object's part structure by use of the model-based vision technique of global search-and-match. We present several examples of recovering part structure using various types of range imagery to show that the recovery procedure is robust.",

ABSTRACT="In order to plan operations where knowledge of significant elements is imprecise and uncertain, a means of characterizing the situation in terms of the various factors that may influence those operations must be provided. In this paper we discuss an approach to that characterization that uses evidential reasoning to handle the uncertainty, imprecision, and incompleteness typical of sources of real-world information and knowledge, to support planning routes for military helicopters. Evidential reasoning is a maturing collection of inference techniques for reasoning with uncertain information. Based on the Shafer-Dempster theory of evidence, evidential reasoning uses a non-Bayesian updating scheme to combine evidence provided by multiple, diverse knowledge sources. Knowledge sources in an evidential reasoning system are not required to attribute their belief to a universe of discourse comprised solely of mutually exclusive, exhaustive, singleton events, as required by a classical probability approach. Rather, they may express levels of ignorance explicitly by allocating belief to disjunctions of propositions, thereby leading directly to an interval measure of belief; ignorance is expressed by the width of this interval. Evidential reasoning evolved from consideration of appropriate models for reasoning about information acquired from sensors, and therefore seems natural for drawing conclusions from sensor data and prestored maps regarding the degree to which a selected geographic area will support certain activities. Here, we discuss evidential reasoning and illustrate the utility of the technology for classifying geographic areas by describing our current map-and-sensor-based research in which we estimate the utility of land areas for concealing helicopter operations.",

ABSTRACT="The purpose of this paper is to construct a model of actions and events that facilitates reasoning about dynamic domains involving multiple agents. Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed model allows for the simultaneous performance of actions, rather than use an interleaving approximation. A generalized situation calculus is constructed for describing and reasoning about actions in multiagent settings. Notions of {\it independence} and {\it correctness} are introduced, and it is shown how they can be used to determine the persistence of facts over time and whether or not actions can be performed concurrently. Unlike most previous formalisms in both single- and multiagent domains, the proposed law of persistence is {\it monotonic} and thus has a well-defined model-theoretic semantics. It is shown how the concept of {\it causality} can be employed to simplify the description of actions and to model arbitrarily complex machines and physical devices. Furthermore, it is shown how sets of causally interrelated actions can be grouped together in {\it processes} and how this structuring of problem domains can substantially reduce combinatorial complexity. Finally, it is indicated how the law of persistence, together with the notion of causality, makes it possible to retain a simple model of action while avoiding most of the difficulties associated with the frame problem.",

ABSTRACT="The importance of plan inference in models of conversation has been widely noted in the com\-putational-linguistics literature, and its incorporation in question-answering systems has enabled a range of cooperative behaviors. The plan inference process in each of these systems, however, has assumed that the questioner (Q), whose plan is being inferred, and the respondent (R), who is drawing the inference, have identical beliefs about the actions in the domain. I demonstrate that this assumption is too strong and that it often results in failure not only of the plan-inference process, but also of the communicative process that plan inference is meant to support. In particular, it precludes the principled generation of appropriate responses to queries that arise from invalid plans. I present a model of plan inference in conversation that distinguishes between the beliefs of the questioner and the beliefs of the respondent. This model rests on an account of plans as mental phenomena: ``having a plan'' is analyzed as having a particular configuration of beliefs and intentions. Judgments that a plan is invalid are associated with particular discrepancies between the beliefs that R ascribes to Q, when R believes that Q has some particular plan, and the beliefs that R herself holds. I define several types of invalidities from which a plan may suffer, relating each to a particular type of belief discrepancy, and show that the types of any invalidities judged to be present in the plan underlying a query can affect the context of a cooperative response. The plan inference model has been implemented in SPIRIT, a System for Plan Inference that Reasons about Invalidities Too, which reasons about plans underlying queries in the domain of computer mail.",

Our model is based on first-order temporal logic, which has a well-understood semantics and has been employed extensively in concurrency theory.

A robot that blindly follows a program or plan without verifying that its operations are having their intended effects is not reactive. For simple tasks in carefully engineered domains, non-reactive behavior is acceptable; for more intelligent agents in unconstrained domains, it is not. This paper presents the outline of an architecture for intelligent reactive systems. Much of the discussion will relate to the problem of designing an autonomous mobile robot, but the ideas are independent of the particular system. The architecture is motivated by the desires for modularity, awareness, and robustness.",

The bulk of the paper presents both problems encountered during the process of encoding this domain, and extensions of the planning system that were made to solve them. The most significant addition was a redesign of the deductive capability of the planner, which is described in some detail. Efficiency considerations and the ability to intermingle planning and execution are discussed. The most important problem encountered involved hierarchical planning, an ambiguous term. We present a definition of it, and examine several of the reasons for this ambiguity. An explication of hierarchical-planning implementations entails two distinct notions: abstraction level and planning level. A problem in currently implemented planners that is caused by mixing these two levels is presented and various remedies suggested. Three solutions that have been implemented in the current SIPE planning system are described.",

The determination relation is a logical generalization of the different types of dependency relations defined in database theory. Specifically, we define determination as a relation between schemata of first order logic that have two kinds of free variables: (1) object variables and (2) what we call ``polar'' variables, which hold the place of truth values. Determination rules facilitate sound rule inference and valid conclusions projected by analogy from single instances, without implying what the conclusion should be prior to an inspection of the instance. They also provide a way to specify what information is sufficiently relevant to decide a question, prior to knowledge of the answer to the question.",

ABSTRACT="In this paper, the reasoning and planning capabilities of an autonomous mobile robot are described. The reasoning system that controls the robot is designed to exhibit the kind of behavior expected of a rational agent, and is endowed with the psychological attitudes of belief, desire, and intention. Because these attitudes are explicitly represented, they can be manipulated and reasoned about, resulting in complex goal-directed and reflective behaviors. Unlike most planning systems, the plans or intentions formed by the robot need only be partly elaborated before it decides to act. This allows the robot to avoid overly strong expectations about the environment, overly constrained plans of action, and other forms of overcommitment common to previous planners. In addition, the robot is continuously reactive and has the ability to change its goals and intentions as situations warrant. Thus, while the system architecture allows for reasoning about means and ends in much the same way as traditional planners, it also possesses the reactivity required for survival in highly dynamic and uncertain worlds. The system has been tested with SRI's autonomous robot (Flakey) in a space station scenario involving navigation and the performance of emergency tasks.",

ABSTRACT="We present a paradigm for discovering the outlines of arbitrarily complex cultural objects in aerial imagery. The approach starts with a low-level image partition and generic (as opposed to specific or template-like) object descriptions. We then use geometric reasoning and context knowledge to suggest corrections to the discrepancies between the segmentation boundaries and the object models. Finally, when the corrections appear consistent with the generic cultural object model, we resegment the partition to produce new labeled regions with clear semantic interpretations. The general features of our approach appear to be applicable to a number of other domains.",

ABSTRACT="A technique for unifying spatial and temporal analysis of an image sequence taken by a camera moving in a straight line is presented. The technique is based on a ``dense'' sequence of images--images taken close enough together to form a solid block of data. Slices of this solid directly encode changes due to motion of the camera. These slices, which have one spatial dimension and one temporal dimension, are more structured than conventional images. This additional structure makes them easier to analyze. We present the theory behind this technique, describe an initial implementations, and discuss our preliminary results.",

ABSTRACT="The syntactic structure of a sentence often manifests quite clearly the predicate-argument structure and relations of grammatical subordination. But scope dependencies are not so transparent. As a result, many systems for representing the semantics of sentences have ignored scoping or generated scopings with mechanisms that have often been inexplicit as to the range of scopings they choose among or profligate in the scopings they allow. In this paper, we present an algorithm, along with proofs of some of its important properties, that generates scoped semantic forms from unscoped expressions encoding predicate-argument structure. The algorithm is not profligate as are those based on permutation of quantifiers, and it can provide a solid foundation for computational solutions where completeness is sacrificed for efficiency and heuristic efficacy.",

ABSTRACT="This report describes a reactive system for reasoning about and performing complex tasks in dynamic environments. A powerful and theoretically sound scheme for representing and reasoning about actions and processes has been devised. The representation is sufficiently rich to describe the effects of arbitrary sequences of tests and actions, and the reasoning mechanism provides a means for directly using this knowledge to attain desired goals or to react to critical situations. A declarative semantics for the representation has been constructed that allows a user to specify facts about behaviors independently of context. An operational semantics has also been defined that shows how these facts can be used by a system to achieve its goals. Possession of both a declarative and an operational semantics provides the system with the ability to reason about complex actions, to explain its reasoning to others, to cope with modifications to its environment, and to be amenable to verification. The system also includes powerful metalevel reasoning capabilities, using the same formalism for representing this knowledge as for object-level knowledge. A practical implementation of such a system has been constructed and applied to some crucial problems in the automation of space operations.",

ABSTRACT="It has been argued that knowledge-based systems (KBS) must reason from evidential information--i.e., information that is to some degree uncertain, imprecise, and occasionally inaccurate. This is no less true of KBS that operate in the domain of computer-based image interpretation. Recent research has suggested that the work of Dempster and Shafer (DS) provides a viable alternative to Bayesian-based techniques for reasoning from evidential information. In this paper, we discuss some of the differences between the DS theory and some popular Bayesian-based approaches to effecting the reasoning task. We then discuss some work on integrating the DS theory into a knowledge-based high-level computer vision system in order to examine various aspects of this new technology that have not been explored to date. Results from a large number of image interpretation experiments will be presented. These results suggest that a KBS's performance improves substantially when it exploits various features of the DS theory that are not readily available in pure Bayesian-based approaches.",

ABSTRACT="A stochastic optimization approach to stereo matching is presented. Unlike conventional correlation matching and feature matching, the approach provides a dense array of disparities, eliminating the need for interpolation. First, the stereo matching problem is defined in terms of finding a disparity map that satisfies two competing constraints: (1) matched points should have similar image intensity, and (2) the disparity map should be smooth. These constraints are expressed in an ``energy'' function that can be evaluated locally. A simulated annealing algorithm is used to find a disparity map that has very low energy (i.e., in which both constraints have simultaneously been approximately satisfied). Annealing allows the large-scale structure of the disparity map to emerge at higher temperatures, and avoids the problem of converging too quickly on a local minimum. Results are shown for a sparse random-dot stereogram, a vertical aerial stereogram (shown in comparison to ground truth), and an oblique ground-level scene with occlusion boundaries.",

ABSTRACT="This paper presents a general criterion for measuring the degree to which any given theory can be considered a good explanation of a particular body of data. A formal definition of what constitutes an acceptable explanation of a body of data is given, and the length of explanation used as a measure for selecting the best of a set of competing theories. Unlike most previous approaches to inductive inference, the length of explanation includes a measure of the complexity or likelihood of a theory as well as a measure of the degree of fit between theory and data. In this way, prior expectations about the environment can be represented, thus providing a hypothesis space in which search for good or optimal theories is made more tractable. Furthermore, it is shown how theories can be represented as structures that reflect the conceptual entities used to describe and reason about the given problem domain.",

YEAR=1985,
ABSTRACT="Syntactic processes that have been identified as sources of discontinuous constituents exhibit radically different properties. They seem to fall into several classes: leftward ``extraction,'' right-ward ``movements,'' ``scrambling'' phenomena, and parenthetical insertions. Current linguistic theories differ as to the formal tools they employ both for describing the participating syntactic phenomena and for encoding the resulting representations. In this paper, the general problem of determining the linear order in the discontinuous parts of a constituent is discussed. The focus lies on frameworks that use their feature mechanisms for connecting the noncontiguous elements. It is then shown that the current framework of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG) is not suited for describing the interaction of leftward extractions, scrambling, and constraints on linear order. The relevant data come from German fronting. Previous analyses (Johnson 1983; Nerbonne 1984; Uszkoreit 1982; 1984) have neglected certain types of fronting or failed to integrate their account of fronting properly with an analysis of linear precedence.",

ABSTRACT="A single two-dimensional image is an ambiguous representation of the three-dimensional world--many different scenes could have produced the same image--yet the human visual system is extremely successful at recovering a qualitatively correct depth model from this type of representation. Workers in the field of computational vision have devised a number of distinct schemes that attempt to emulate this human capability; these schemes are collectively known as ``shape from....'' methods (e.g., shape from shading, shape from texture, or shape from contour). In this paper we contend that the distinct assumptions made in each of these schemes must be tantamount to providing a second (virtual) image of the original scene, and that any one of these approaches can be translated into a conventional stereo formalism. In particular, we show that it is frequently possible to structure the problem as one of recovering depth from a stereo pair consisting of the supplied perspective image (the original image) and an hypothesized orthographic image (the virtual image). We present a new algorithm of the form required to accomplish this type of stereo reconstruction task.",

ABSTRACT="Partially free word order as it occurs in German and probably to some extent in all natural languages arises through the interaction of potentially conflicting ordering principles. A modified linear precedence (LP) component of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG) is proposed that accommodates partially free word order. In the revised framework, LP rules are sets of LP clauses. In a case in which these clauses make conflicting ordering predictions, more than one order is grammatical. LP clauses may refer to different types of categorial information such as category features, morphological case, thematic roles, discourse roles, and phonological information. The modified framework is applied to examples from German. It is demonstrated how the new LP component constrains the linear ordering of major nominal categories.",

That is, we should take seriously the notion that an agent's cognitive state expresses beliefs about the world, desires or goals to change the world, and intentions or plans that are likely to achieve these goals. In cooperative situations, reasoning about these cognitive structures is important for communication and problem-solving. How can we construct such models of agent cognition? Here I propose an approach that I call it experimental robot psychology because it involves formalizing and reasoning about the design of existing robot agents. It shows promise of yielding an efficient and general means of reasoning about cognitive states.",

ABSTRACT="Although the concept of knowledge plays a central role in artificial intelligence, the theoretical foundations of knowledge representation currently rest on a very limited conception of what it means for a machine to know a proposition. In the current view, the machine is regarded as knowing a fact if its state either explicitly encodes the fact as a sentence of an interpreted formal language or if such a sentence can be derived from other encoded sentences according to the rules of an appropriate logical system. We contract this conception, the interpreted-symbolic-structure approach, with another, the situated-automata approach, which seeks to analyze knowledge in terms of relations between the state of a machine and the state of its environment over time using logic as a metalanguage in which the analysis is carried out.",

ABSTRACT="To support our reasoning abilities perception must recover environment regularities--e.g., rigidity, ``objectness,'' axes of symmetry--for later use of cognition. To create a theory of how our perceptual apparatus can produce meaningful cognitive primitives from an array of image intensities we require a representation whose elements may be lawfully related to important physical regularities, and that correctly describes the perceptual organization people impose on the stimulus. Unfortunately, the representations that are currently available were originally developed for other purposes (e.g., physics, engineering) and have so far proven unsuitable for the problems of perception or commonsense reasoning. In answer to this problem we present a representation that has proven competent to accurately describe an extensive variety of natural forms (e.g., people, mountains, clouds, trees), as well as man-made forms, in a succinct and natural manner. The approach taken in this representational system is to describe scene structure at a scale that is similar to our naive perceptual notion of ``a part,'' by use of descriptions that reflect a possible formative history of the object, e.g., how the object might have been constructed from lumps of clay. For this representation to be useful it must be possible to recover such descriptions from image data; we show that the primitive elements of such descriptions may be recovered in an overconstrained and therefore reliable manner. We believe that this descriptive system makes an important contribution towards solving current problems in perceiving and reasoning about natural forms by allowing us to construct accurate descriptions that are extremely compact and that capture people's intuitive notions about the part structure of three-dimensional forms.",

These rules, the \underline{relation replacement} and \underline{relation matching} rules, generalize to an arbitrary binary relation the paramodulation and E-resolution rules, respectively, for equality, and may operate within a nonclausal or clausal system. The new rules depend on an extension of the notion of \underline{polarity} to apply to subterms as well as to subsentences, with respect to a given binary relation. The rules allow us to eliminate troublesome axioms, such as transitivity and monotonicity, from the system; proofs are shorter and more comprehensible, and the search space is correspondingly deflated.",

A series of design alternatives, some theoretically and some practically motivated, is then based on the resultant criteria. We present one way of pinning down these choices which culminates in a description of a particular grammar formalism for use in computer linguistic tools.

ABSTRACT="In real-world domains (e.g., a mobile robot environment), things do not always proceed as planned, so it is important to develop better execution-monitoring techniques and replanning capabilities. This paper describes these capabilities in the SIPE planning system. The motivation behind SIPE is to place enough limitations on the representation so that planning can be done efficiently, while retaining sufficient power to still be useful. This work assumes that new information given to the execution monitor is in the form of predicates, thus avoiding the difficult problem of how to generate these predicates from information provided by sensors. The replanning module presented here takes advantage of the rich structure of SIPE plans and is intimately connected with the planner, which can be called as a subroutine. This allows the use of SIPE's capabilities to determine efficiently how unexpected events affect the plan being executed and, in many cases, to retain most of the original plan by making changes in it to avoid problems caused by these unexpected events. SIPE is also capable of shortening the original plan when serendipitous events occur. A general set of replanning actions is presented along with a general replanning capability that has been implemented by using these actions.",

The body of the paper addresses the criteria for relating surface forms to logical form representations, and offers a unified analysis of adjectives and their adverbial counterparts in logical form while maintaining a clear distinction between operators and predicates; this requires the postulation of a factive sentential operator and the relaxation of the one-to-one syntax-semantics correspondence hypothesis.

The prototype TEAM software described herein was developed by the Artificial Intelligence Center of SRI International to demonstrate the system's capabilities and adaptive potential. This user's guide is designed to assist new TEAM users to learn about the concepts and tasks involved in retrieving data and in preparing a demonstration for a new application area. An effort has been made to illustrate some of the problems TEAM must solve in translating an English question into a database query. However, the necessarily limited scope of this guide cannot include a discussion of all the natural-language-processing issues addressed by the system; our emphasis is on a practical, rather than theoretical, understanding of the concepts. Similarly, while this guide cannot cover every detail of creating a new demonstration for TEAM, it does provide a thorough introduction to the procedure to be followed and explains how to use the on-line ``help'' provided by the system. This introductory manual is designed to be read in conjunction with actual use of the system. While a casual perusal of this document may acquaint the reader with some of TEAM's features, using the examples and suggestions as a practical guide to actually experimenting with the system will prove a much more effective method of learning how to use TEAM and becoming familiar with both its capabilities and its limitations. Much of this guide consists of comments, descriptions, and other background information, but the user is frequently instructed to perform some action as a learning experience. In the examples shown in the text, the portions printed in boldface are typed as selected by the user; these portions may or may not appear in boldface on the screen when TEAM is used. In the examples illustrated by figures, however, the type faces do correspond exactly to the screen display.",

ABSTRACT="We are implementing a baseline system for automated area-based stereo compilation. This system, STSYS, operates in several passes over the data, during which it iteratively builds, checks, and refines its model of the 3-dimensional world, as represented by a pair of images. In this papers, we describe the components of STSYS and give examples of the results it produces. We find that these results agree reasonably well with those produced on the interactive DIMP system at ETL, the best available benchmark.",

ABSTRACT="Theory resolution constitutes a set of complete procedures for incorporating theories into a resolution theorem-proving program, thereby making it unnecessary to resolve directly upon axioms of the theory. This can greatly reduce the length of proofs and the size o the search space. Theory resolution effects a beneficial division of labor, improving the performance of the theorem prover and increasing the applicability of the specialized reasoning procedures. Total theory resolution utilizes a decision procedure that is capable of determining unsatisfiability of any set of clauses using predicates in the theory. Partial theory resolution employs a weaker decision procedure that can determine potential unsatisfiability of sets of literals. Applications include the building in of both mathematical and special decision procedures, e.g., for the taxonomic information furnished by a knowledge representation system. Theory resolution is a generalization of numerous previously known resolution refinements. Its power is demonstrated by comparing solutions of ``Schubert's Steamroller'' challenge problem with or without building in axioms through theory resolution.",

YEAR=1984,
ABSTRACT="A relatively simple method for handling higher-order functions (funargs) in LISP is described. It is also shown how this scheme allows extension of the LISP language to include partial application of functions. The basis of the approach is to defer evaluation of function-valued expressions until sufficient arguments have been accumulated to reduce the expression to a nonfunctional value. This results in stacklike environment structures rather than the treelike structures produced by standard evaluation schemes. Consequently, the evaluator can be implemented on a standard runtime stack without requiring the complex storage management schemes usually employed for handling higher-order functions. A full version of LISP has been implemented by modifying the FRANZ LISP interpreter to incorporate the new scheme. These modifications prove to be both simple and efficient.",

ABSTRACT="Attempts have been made to speed up image-understanding computation involving conventional serial algorithms by decomposing these algorithms into portions that can be computed in parallel. Because many classes of algorithms do not readily decompose, one seeks some other basis for parallelism (i.e, for using additional hardware to obtain higher processing speed). In this paper we argue that ``parallel guessing'' for image analysis is a useful approach, and that several recent IU algorithms are based on this concept. Problems suitable for this approach have the characteristic that either ``distance'' from a true solution, or the correctness of a guess, can be readily checked. We review image-analysis algorithms having a parallel guessing or randomness flavor. We envision a parallel set of computers, each of which carries out a computation on a data set using some random or guessing process, and communicate the ``goodness'' of its results to its co-workers through a ``blackboard'' mechanisms.",

ABSTRACT="In a previous paper [Moore, 1983a, 1983b], we presented a nonmonotonic logic for modeling the beliefs of ideally rational agents who reflect on their own beliefs, which we call ``autoepistemic logic.'' We define a simple and intuitive semantics for autoepistemic logic and proved the logic sound and complete with respect to that semantics. However, the nonconstructive character of both the logic and its semantics made it difficult to prove the existence of sets of beliefs satisfying all the constraints of autoepistemic logic. This note presents an alternative, possible-world semantics for autoepistemic logic that enables us to construct finite models for autoepistemic theories, as well as to demonstrate the existence of sound and complete autoepistemic theories based on given sets of premises.",

ABSTRACT="The SLICE textured-image segmentation system identifies image regions that differ in gray-level distribution, color, spatial texture, or other local property. It has been developed for the analysis of aerial imagery, although it can be used for any domain in which homogeneous image regions must be found prior to interpretation or enhancement. This report concentrates on textured-image segmentation using local texture-energy measures and user-delimited training regions. The SLICE algorithm combines knowledge of target textures or signatures with knowledge of background textures by using histogram-similarity transforms. Regions of high similarity to a target texture and of low similarity to any negative examples are identified and then mapped back to the original image. This use of texture-similarity transforms during the segmentation process improves segmenter performance and focuses segmentation activity on material types of greatest interest. The system can also be used for goal-independent texture segmentation by omitting the similarity-transform computations, and its hierarchical, recursive segmentation strategy integrates very well with other image-analysis techniques.",

ABSTRACT="TABLOG (Tableau Logic Programming Language) is a language based on first-order predicate logic with equality that combines functional and logic programming. TABLOG incorporate advantages of LISP and PROLOG. A program in TABLOG is a list of formulas in a first-order logic (including equality, negation, and equivalence) that is more general and more expressive than PROLOG's Horn Clauses. Whereas PROLOG programs must be relational, TABLOG programs may define either relations or functions. While LISP programs yield results of a computation by returning a single output value, TABLOG programs can be relations and can produce several results simultaneously through their arguments. TABLOG employs the Manna-Waldinger \underline{deductive-tableau} proof system as an interpreter in the same way that PROLOG uses a resolution-based proof system. Unification is used by TABLOG to match a call with a line in the program and to bind arguments. The basic rules of deduction used for computing are nonclausal resolution and rewriting by means of equality and equivalence. A pilot interpreter for the language has been implemented.",

ABSTRACT="This report is a compilation of papers by the PATR group in the Artificial Intelligence Center at SRI International reporting on ongoing research on both practical and theoretical issues concerning grammar formalisms. The current formalism being simultaneously designed, implemented and used by the group, PATR-II, is based on unification of directed-graph structures. Unification is thus a theme both of our research, and of the papers reproduced in this volume. These papers provide an overview of the design of PATR-II (Chapter 1), a discussion of the use of disjunction and negation in unification-based feature systems (Chapter 2), and a theoretical framework for unification-based grammar formalisms which is founded on the domain-theoretic techniques of Data Scott (Chapter 3). All three chapters are versions of papers presented at the Tenth International Conference on Computational Linguistics at Stanford University, Stanford, California during July 2 through 7, 1984. The research was initially part of the KLAUS (Knowledge Learning and Using System) project at SRI, set up with the intention of experimenting with mathematically well-founded alternatives to the DIALOGIC natural-language processing system. The more theoretical research was made possible in part by a gift from the Systems Development Foundation and was conducted as part of a coordinated research effort with the Computer Language subprogram at the Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University. The PATR group at SRI is a rather liquid group of researchers which has included, at various times, John Bear, Lauri Karttunen, Fernando Pereira, Jane Robinson, Stan Rosenschein, Stuart Shieber, Susan Stucky, Mabry Tyson, and Hans Uszkoreit. The research reported here is a direct result of their aid and interaction.

ABSTRACT="Reasoning about the knowledge and beliefs of computer and human agents is assuming increasing importance in artificial intelligence systems for natural language, understanding, planning, and knowledge representation. A natural model of belief for robot agents is the deduction model: an agent is represented as having an initial set of beliefs about the world in some internal language and a deduction process for deriving some (but not necessarily all) logical consequences of these beliefs. Because the deduction model is explicitly computational model, it is possible to take into account limitations of an agent's resources when reasoning. This thesis is an investigation of a Gentzen-type formalization of the deductive model of belief. Several original results are proved. Among these are soundness and completeness theorems for a deductive belief logic; a correspondence result that relates our deduction model to competing possible-world models; and a model analog to Herbrand's Theorem for the belief logic. Specialized techniques for automatic deduction based on resolution are developed using this theorem. Several other topics of knowledge and belief are explored in the thesis from the viewpoint of the deduction model, including: \begin{itemize} \item A theory of introspection about self-beliefs \item A theory of circumscriptive ignorance, in which facts that an agent doesn't know are formalized by limiting or circumscribing the information available to him. \end{itemize} This report is a slightly revised version of a thesis submitted to the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University in June 1984, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.",

ABSTRACT="The problem of interpreting single images of abstract figures is addressed. It is argued that neither rule-based deductive inference nor model-based matching are satisfactory computational paradigms for this problem. As an alternative, an inductive approach consisting of two parts is presented. The first part involves a scheme, based on differential geometry, for describing the shapes of curves and surfaces, and for generating these descriptions from images. The second part of the approach relies on a criterion for deciding which description, among the candidates allowed by the constraints in the image, is to be preferred. This criterion--minimum entropy--is related to concepts from Gestalt psychology, thermodynamics, and information theory. Several examples are given to illustrate the inductive approach.",

MONTH=jul,
YEAR=1984,
ABSTRACT="Expert systems that operate in complex domains are continually confronted with the problem of deciding what to do next. Being able to reach a decision requires, in part, having the capacity to ``reason'' about a set of alternative actions. It has been argued that expert systems must reason from evidential information--i.e., uncertain, incomplete, and occasionally inaccurate information [Low82a]. As a consequence, a model for reasoning about control must be capable of performing several tasks: to combine the evidential information that is generically distinct and from disparate sources; to overcome minor inaccuracies in the evidential information that is needed to reach a decision; to reason about what additional evidential information is required; to explain the actions taken (based on such information) by the system. These are a few of the formidable control problems that remain largely unsolved [Bar82]. If expert systems are to improve their performance significantly, they must utilize increasingly sophisticated and general models for dealing with the evidential information required for reasoning about their behavior. To this end we present an alternative evidentially-based approach to reasoning about control that has several advantages over existing techniques. It enables us to reason from limited and imperfect information; to partition bodies of meta- and domain-knowledge into modular components; and to order potential actions flexibly by allowing any number of constraints (i.e., control strategies) to be imposed over a set of alternative actions. Furthermore, because it can be used for reasoning about the expenditure of additional resources to obtain the evidential information needed as a basis for choosing among alternatives, this approach can be employed recursively.",

ABSTRACT="Artificial intelligence (AI) and other developments in computer science are giving birth to a dramatically different class of machines--machines that can perform tasks requiring reasoning, judgment, and perception that previously could be done only by humans. Will these machines reduce the need for human toil and thus cause unemployment? there are two opposing views in response to this question. Some claim that AI is not really very different from other technologies that have supported automation and increased productivity--technologies such as mechanical engineering, electronics, control engineering, and operations research. Like them, AI may also lead ultimately to an expanding economy with a concomitant expansion of employment opportunities. At worst, according to this view, there will be some, perhaps even substantial shifts in the \underline{types} of jobs, but certainly no overall reduction in the total \underline{number} of jobs. In my opinion, however, such an outcome is based on an overly conservative appraisal of the real potential of artificial intelligence.",

(Although we cannot always establish the consistency of a finite set of sentences of first-order logic, our method is usable in those cases in which we can.) The method described in the present paper combines logic with probability theory in such a way that probabilistic logical entailment reduces to ordinary logical entailment when the probabilities of all sentences are either 0 or 1.",

ABSTRACT="Most work on planning and problem solving within the field of artificial intelligence assumes that the agent has complete knowledge of all relevant aspects of the problem domain and problem situation. In the real world, however, planning and acting must frequently be performed without complete knowledge. This imposes two additional burdens on an intelligent agent trying to act effectively. First, when the agent entertains a plan for achieving some goal, he must consider not only whether the physical prerequisites of the plan have been satisfied, but also whether he has all the information necessary to carry out the plan. Second, he must be able to reason about what he can do to obtain necessary information that he lacks. In this paper, we present a theory of action in which these problems are taken into account, showing how to formalize both the knowledge prerequisites of action and the effects of action on knowledge.",

ABSTRACT="Two artificially intelligent (AI) computer agents begin to play a game of chess, and the following conversation ensues: \begin{itemize} \item S1: Do you know the rules of chess? \item S2: Yes. \item S1: Then you know whether White has a forced initial win or not. \item S2: Upon reflection, I realize that I must. \item S1: Then there is no reason to play. \item S2: No. \end{itemize} Both agents are state-of-the-art constructions, incorporating the latest AI research in chess playing, natural-language understanding, planning, etc. But because of the overwhelming combinatorics of chess, neither they nor the fastest foreseeable computers would be able to search the entire game tree to find out whether White has a forced win. Why then do they come to such an odd conclusion about their own knowledge of the game? The chess scenario is an anecdotal example of the way inaccurate cognitive models can lead to behavior that is less than intelligent in artificial agents. In this case, the agents' model of belief is not correct. They make the assumption that an agent actually knows all the consequences of his beliefs. S1 knows that chess is a finite game, and thus reasons that, in principle, knowing the rules of chess is all that is required to figure out whether White has a forced initial win. After learning that S2 does indeed know the rules of chess, he comes to the erroneous conclusion that S2 also knows this particular consequence of the rules. and S2 himself, reflecting on his own knowledge in the same manner, arrives at the same conclusion, even though in actual fact he could never carry out the computations necessary to demonstrate it.",

ABSTRACT="This paper discusses the use of selected artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for integrating multisource information in order to develop an understanding of an ongoing situation. The approach takes an active, ``top-down'' view of the task, projecting a situation description forward in time, determining gaps in the current model, and tasking sensors to acquire data to fill the gaps. Information derived from tasked sensors and other sources is combined using new, non-Bayesian inference techniques. This active approach seems critical to solve the problems posed by the low emission signatures anticipated for near-future threats. Simulation experiments lead to the conclusion that the utility of ESM system operation in future conflicts will depend on how effectively onboard sensing resources are managed by the system. The view of AI that will underly the discussion is that of a technology attempting to extend automation capabilities from the current ``replace the human's hands'' approach to that of replacing or augmenting the human's cognitive and perceptual capabilities. Technology transfer issues discussed in the presentation are the primary motivation for highlighting this view. The paper will conclude with a discussion of unresolved problems associated with the introduction of AI technology into real world military systems.",

ABSTRACT="Charles A. Rosen came to SRI in 1957. I arrived in 1961. Between these dates, Charlie organized an Applied Physics Laboratory and became interested in ``learning machines'' and ``self-organizing systems.'' That interest launched a group that ultimately grew into a major world center of artificial intelligence research--a center that has endured twenty-five years of boom and bust in fashion, has ``graduated'' over a hundred AI research professionals, and has generated ideas and programs resulting in new products and companies as well as scientific articles, books, and this particular collection itself. The SRI Artificial Intelligence Center has always been an extremely cohesive group, even though it is associated with many contrasting themes. Perhaps these very contrasts are responsible for its vitality. It is a group of professional researchers, but visiting Ph.D. candidates (mainly from Stanford University) have figured prominently in its intellectual achievements. It is not part of a university, yet its approach to AI has often been more academic and basic than those used in some of the prominent university laboratories. For many years a vocal group among its professionals has strongly emphasized the role of logic and the centrality of reasoning and declarative representation in AI, but it is also home to many researchers who pursue other aspects of the discipline. Far more people have left it (to pursue careers in industry) than are now part of it, yet it is still about as large as it has ever been and retains a more or less consistent character. It is an American research group, supported largely by the Defense Department, but, from the beginning, it has been a melting pot of nationalities.",

ABSTRACT="If it is possible to interpret an image as a projection of rectangular forms, there is a strong tendency for people to do so. In effect, a mathematical basis for a vector space appropriate to the world, rather than to the image, is selected. A computational solution to this problem is presented. It works by backprojecting image features into three-dimensional space, thereby generating (potentially) all possible interpretations, and by selecting those which are maximally orthogonal. In general, two solutions that correspond to perceptual reversals are found. The problem of choosing one of these is related to the knowledge of verticality. A measure of consistency of image features with a hypothetical solution is defined. In conclusion, the model supports an information-theoretic interpretation of the Gestalt view of perception.",

ABSTRACT="A method for synthesizing multi-agent plans from simpler single-agent plans is described. The idea is to insert communication acts into the single-agent plans so that agents can synchronize activities and avoid harmful interactions. Unlike most previous planning systems, actions are represented by \underline{sequences} of states, rather than as simple state change operators. This allows the expression of more complex kinds of interaction than would otherwise be possible. An efficient method of interaction and safety analysis is then developed and used to identify critical regions in the plans. An essential feature of the method is that the analysis is performed without generating all possible interleavings of the plans, thus avoiding a combinatorial explosion. Finally, communication primitives are inserted into the plans and a supervisor process created to handle synchronization.",

ABSTRACT="The Image Understanding Testbed is a system of hardware and software that is designed to facilitate the integration, testing, and evaluation of implemented research concepts in machine vision. The system was developed by the Artificial Intelligence Center of SRI International under the joint sponsorship of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Defense Mapping Agency (DMA). The primary purpose of the Image Understanding (IU) Testbed is to provide a means for transferring technology from the DARPA-sponsored IU research program to DMA and other organizations in the defense community. The approach taken to achieve this purpose has two components: \begin{itemize} \item The establishment of a uniform environment that will be as compatible as possible with the environments of research centers at universities participating in the IU program. Thus, organizations obtaining copies of the testbed can receive new results of ongoing research as they become available. \item The acquisition, integration, testing, and evaluation of selected scene analysis techniques that represent mature examples of generic areas of research activity. These contributions from IU program participants will allow organizations with testbed copies to immediately begin investigating potential applications of IU technology to problems in automated cartography and other areas of scene analysis. \end{itemize} An important component of the DARPA IU research program is the development of image-understanding techniques that could be applied to automated cartography and military image interpretation tasks; this work forms the principal focus of the testbed project. A number of computer modules developed by participants in the IU program have been transported to the uniform testbed environment as a first step in the technology transfer process. These include systems written in UNIX C, MAINSAIL, and FRANZ LISP. Capabilities of the computer programs include segmentation, linear feature delineation, shape detection, stereo reconstruction, and rule-based recognition of classes of three-dimensional objects.",

ABSTRACT="This report describes an abstract Prolog instruction set suitable for software, firmware, or hardware implementation. The instruction set is abstract in that certain details of its encoding and implementation are left open, so that it may be realized in a number of different forms. The forms that are contemplated are: \begin{itemize} \item Translation into a compact bytecode, with emulators written in C (for maximum portability), Progol (a macrolanguage generating machine code, for efficient software implementations as an alternative to direct compilation on machines such as the VAX), and VAX-730 microcode. \item Compilation into the standard instructions of machines such as the VAX or DECsystem-10/20. \item Hardware (or firmware) emulation of the instruction set on a specially designed Prolog processor. \end{itemize} The abstract machine described herein (``new Prolog Engine'') is a major revision of the ``old Prolog Engine'' described in a previous document. The new model overcomes certain difficulties in the old model, which are discussed in a later section. The new model can be considered to be a modification of the old model, where the stack contains compiler-defined goals called environments instead of user-defined goals. The environments correspond to some number of goals forming the tail of a clause. The old model was developed having primarily in mind a VAX-730 microcode implementation. The new model has, in addition, been influenced by hardware implementation considerations, but should remain equally amenable to software or firmware implementation on machines such as the VAX.",

ABSTRACT="Reasoning from uncertain, incomplete, and sometimes inaccurate information is necessary whenever any system is to interact in an intelligent way with its environment. This follows directly from the fact that understanding the world is possible only by perceiving it through a set of knowledge sources that provide partially processed sensory information. Because of the limited capabilities of any sensor, the information is inherently ``evidential.'' That is, perceptual information is not readily captured in terms of simple truths and falsities or in terms of probabilistic estimates, when the appropriate statistical data are lacking. Therefore, neither logical nor standard probabilistic reasoning techniques are uniformly applicable in this context.",

ABSTRACT="Metarule phrase-structure grammars (MPS grammars) have been shown to be an extremely powerful formalism in need of constraints from both the computational and the linguistic points of view. One problem with the standard generative interpretation of metarules is the generation of infinite rule sets. Furthermore, even if grammars having this property are disallowed, the possibility of a combinatorial explosion of rules still remains. In the present paper we explore a view of metarules as meta-node-admissibility conditions (MNACs) which allows a non-generative interpretation of metarules. Under such an interpretation, an MPS grammar will not have either of the two problems mentioned above. We find that, under one suggested implementation, the above mentioned problem appears under another guise, so that additional constraints are needed to ensure an effective procedure for checking admissibility conditions in the computational setting. The important observation is that one can, by parsing with MNACs on the fly, recognize languages for which the generative interpretation is not available.",

ABSTRACT="Planning provides the basis for a theory of language generation that considers the communicative goals of the speaker when producing utterances. One central problem in designing a system based on such a theory is specifying the requisite linguistic knowledge in a form that interfaces well with a planning system and allows for the encoding of discourse information. The TELEGRAM (TELEological GRAMmar) system described in this paper solves this problem by annotating a unification grammar with assertions about how grammatical choices are used to achieve various goals, and by enabling the planner to augment the functional description of an utterance as it is being unified. The control structures of the planner and the grammar unifier are then merged in a manner that makes it possible for general planning to be guided by unification of a particular functional description.",

ABSTRACT="Linguistic theories typically assign various linguistic phenomena to one of the categories, \underline{syntactic}, \underline{semantic}, or \underline{pragmatic}, as if the phenomena in each category were relatively independent of those in the others. However, various phenomena in discourse do not seem to yield comfortably to any account that is strictly a syntactic or semantic or pragmatic one. This paper focuses on particular phenomena of this sort--the use of various referring expressions such as definite noun phrases and pronouns--and examines their interaction with mechanisms used to maintain discourse coherence. Even a casual survey of the literature on definite descriptions and referring expressions reveals not only defects in the individual accounts provided by theorists (from several different disciplines), but also deep confusions about the roles that syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic factors play in accounting for these phenomena. The research we have undertaken is an attempt to sort out some of these confusions and to create the basis for a theoretical framework that can account for a variety of discourse phenomena in which all three factors of language use interact. The major premise on which our research depends is that the concepts necessary for an adequate understanding of the phenomena in question are not exclusively either syntactic or semantic or pragmatic. The next section of this paper defines two levels of discourse coherence and describes their roles in accounting for the use of singular definite noun phrases. To illustrate the integration of factors in explaining the uses of referring expressions, their use on one of these levels, i.e., the local one, is discussed in Sections 3 and 4. This account requires introducing the notion of the centers of a sentence in a discourse, a notion that cannot be defined in terms of factors that are exclusively syntactic or semantic or pragmatic. In Section 5, the interactions of the two levels with these factors and their effects on the uses of referring expressions in discourse are discussed.",

It allows a simple specification of classes of rules that differ only in constituent order. ID/LP grammars (as well as metarule grammars) have been proposed for use in parsing by expanding them into an equivalent context-free grammar. We develop a parsing algorithm, based on the algorithm of Earley, for parsing ID/LP grammars directly, circumventing the initial expansion phase. A proof of correctness of the algorithm is supplied. We also discuss some aspects of the time complexity of the algorithm and some formal properties associated with ID/LP grammars and their relationship to context-free grammars.",

ABSTRACT="The first part of the thesis explains from first principles the concept of ``logic programming'' and its practical application in the programming language Prolog. Prolog is a simple but powerful language which encourages rapid, error-free programming and clear, readable, concise programs. The basic computational mechanism is a pattern matching process (``unification'') operating on general record structures (``terms'' of logic). The ideas are illustrated by describing in detail one sizable Prolog program which implements a simple compiler. The advantages and practicability of using Prolog for ``real'' compiler implementation are discussed. The second part of the thesis describes techniques for implementing Prolog efficiently. In particular, it is shown how to compile the patterns involved in the matching process into instructions of a low-level language. This ideas has actually been implemented in a compiler (written in Prolog) from Prolog to DECsystem-10 assembly language. However, the principles involved are explained more abstractly in terms of a ``Prolog Machine.'' The code generated is comparable in speed with that produced by existing DEC10 Lisp compilers. Comparison is possible since pure Lisp can be viewed as a (rather restricted) subset of Prolog. It is argued that structured data objects, such as lists and trees, can be manipulated by pattern matching using a ``structure sharing'' representation as efficiently as by conventional selector and constructor functions operating on linked records in ``heap'' storage. Moreover, the pattern matching formulation actually helps the implementor to produce a better implementation.",

We consider the informational requirements and restrictions of these approaches. In dealing with the question of what surface parameters can be recovered locally from image shading, we show that, at most, shading determines relative surface curvature, i.e., the ratio of surface curvature measured in orthogonal image directions. The relationship between relative surface curvature and the second derivatives of image irradiance is independent of other scene parameters, but insufficient to determine surface shape. This result places in perspective the difficulty encountered in previous attempts to recover surface orientation from image shading.",

ABSTRACT="The partially free word order in German belongs to the class of phenomena in natural language that require a close interaction between syntax and pragmatics. Several competing principles, which are based on syntactic and on discourse information, determine the linear order of noun phrases. A solution to problems of this sort is a prerequisite for high-quality language generation. The linguistic framework of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar offers tools for dealing with word order variation. Some slight modifications to the framework allow for an analysis of the German data that incorporates just the right degree of interaction between syntactic and pragmatic components and that can account for conflicting ordering statements.",

ABSTRACT="Commonsense reasoning is ``nonmonotonic'' in the sense that we often draw, on the basis of partial information, conclusions that we later retract when we are given more complete information. Some of the most interesting products of recent attempts to formalize nonmonotonic reasoning are the nonmonotonic logics of McDermott and Doyle [McDermott and Doyle, 1980; McDermott, 1982]. These logics, however, all have peculiarities that suggest they do not quite succeed in capturing the intuitions that prompted their development. In this paper we reconstruct nonmonotonic logic as a model of an ideally rational agent's reasoning about his own beliefs. For the resulting system, called \underline{autoepistemic logic}, we define an intuitively based semantics for which we can show autoepistemic logic to be both sound and complete.

ABSTRACT="Metagrammatical formalisms that combine context-free phrase structure rules and metarules (MPS grammars) allow concise statement of generalizations about the syntax of natural languages. Unconstrained MPS grammars, unfortunately, are not computationally ``safe.'' We evaluate several proposals for constraining them, basing our assessment on computational tractability and explanatory adequacy. We show that none of them satisfies both criteria, and suggest new directions for research on alternative metagrammatical formalisms.",

ABSTRACT="Native speakers of English show definite and consistent preferences for certain readings of syntactically ambiguous sentences. A user of a natural-language-processing system would naturally expect it to reflect the same preferences. Thus, such systems must model in some way the \underline{linguistic performance} as well as the \underline{linguistic competence} of the native speaker. We have developed a parsing algorithm--a variant of the LALR(1) shift-reduce algorithm--that models the preference behavior of native speakers for a range of syntactic preference phenomena reported in the psycholinguistic literature, including the recent data on lexical preferences. The algorithm yields the preferred parse deterministically, without building multiple parse trees and choosing among them. As a side effect, it displays appropriate behavior in processing the much discussed garden-path sentences. The parsing algorithm has been implemented and has confirmed the feasibility of our approach to the modeling of these phenomena.",

ABSTRACT="This paper addresses the problems of: (1) representing natural shapes such as mountains, trees, and clouds, and (2) computing their description from image data. To solve these problems, we must be able to relate natural surfaces to their images; this requires a good model of natural surface shapes. Fractal functions are a good choice for modeling 3-D natural surfaces because (1) many physical processes produce a fractal surface shape, (2) fractals are widely used as a graphics tool for generating natural-looking shapes, and (3) a survey of natural imagery has shown that the 3-D fractal surface model, transformed by the image formation process, furnishes an accurate description of both textured and shaded image regions. The 3-D fractal model provides a characterization of 3-D surfaces and their images for which the appropriateness of the model is verifiable. Furthermore, this characterization is stable over transformations of scale and linear transforms of intensity. The 3-D fractal model has been successfully applied to the problems of (1) texture segmentation and classification, (2) estimation of 3-D shape information, and (3) distinguishing between perceptually ``smooth'' and perceptually ``textured'' surfaces in the scene.",

The representation allows any time information to be represented without forcing an over specification.

Thus, organizations obtaining copies of the Testbed can receive a flow of new results derived from ongoing research. \item The acquisition, integration, testing, and evaluation of selected scene analysis techniques that represent mature examples of generic areas of research activity. These contributions from participants in the IU program will allow organizations with Testbed copies to immediately begin investigating potential applications of IU technology to problems in automated cartography and other areas of scene analysis. \end{enumerate} The IU Testbed project was carried out under DARPA Contract No. MDA903-79-C-0588.

To achieve an intimate connection between logical descriptions and computer programs, all the descriptions given are in the definite clause subset of the predicate calculus, which is the basis of the programming language Prolog. The logical descriptions run directly as efficient Prolog programs. Three aspects of the use of logic in natural language analysis are covered: formal representation of syntactic rules by means of a grammar formalism based on logic, extraposition grammars; formal semantics for the chosen English subset, appropriate for data base queries; informal semantic and pragmatic rules to translate analyzed sentences into their formal semantics. On these three aspects, the work improves and extends earlier work by Colmerauer and others, where the use of computational logic in language analysis was first introduced.",

ABSTRACT="The image irradiance equation constrains the relationship between surface orientation in a scene and the irradiance of its image. This equation requires detailed knowledge of both the scene illumination and the reflectance of the surface material. For this equation to be used to recover surface orientation from image irradiance, additional constraints are necessary. The constraints usually employed require that the recovered surface be smooth. We demonstrate that smoothness is not sufficient for this task. A new formulation of shape from shading is presented in which surface orientation is related to image irradiance without requiring detailed knowledge of the scene illumination, or of the albedo of the surface material. This formulation, which assumes isotropic scattering, provides some interesting performance parallels to those exhibited by the human visual system.",

ABSTRACT="Local analysis of image shading, in the absence of prior knowledge about the viewed scene, may be used to provide information about the scene. The following has been proved. \underline{Every} image point has the same image intensity and first and second derivatives as the image of an umbilical point (a point with equal principal curvatures) on a Lambertian surface; there is \underline{exactly one} combination of surface orientation, curvature, (overhead) illumination direction and albedo times illumination intensity that will produce a particular set of image intensity and first and second derivatives. A solution for the unique combination of surface orientation, etc., at umbilical points is presented. This solution has been extended by using general position and regional constraints to obtain estimates of the following: \begin{itemize} \item Surface orientation at each image point \item Whether the surface is planar, singly or doubly curved at each point \item The mean illuminant direction within a region \item Whether a region is convex, concave, or is a saddle surface. \end{itemize} Algorithms to recover illuminant direction, identify discontinuities, and estimate surface orientation have been evaluated on both natural and synthesized images, and have been found to produce useful information about the scene.",

ABSTRACT="A fundamental problem in computer vision is how to determine the 3-D spatial orientation of curves and surfaces appearing in an image. The problem is generally under-constrained, and is complicated by the fact that metric properties, such as orientation and length, are not invariant under projection. Under perspective projection (the correct model for most real images) the transform is nonlinear, and therefore hard to invert. Two constructive methods are presented. The first finds the orientation of parallel lines and planes by locating vanishing points and vanishing lines. The second determines the orientation of plans by ``backprojection'' of two intrinsic properties of contours: angle magnitude and curvature.",

The formalism also offers efficient methods for representing properties of objects that do not change over time, allows specification of the plan rationale (which includes scoping of conditions and appropriately relating different levels in the hierarchy), and provides the ability to express deductive rules for deducing the effects of actions. The implications of allowing parallel actions in a plan or problem solution are discussed, and new techniques for efficiently detecting and remedying harmful parallel interactions are presented. The most important of these techniques, reasoning about resources, is emphasized and explained. The system supports concurrent exploration of different branches in the search, making best-first search easy to implement.",

We argue to the contrary that there is an important set of issues, involving incomplete knowledge of a problem situation, that so far have been addressed only by systems based on formal logic and deductive inference, and that, in some sense, probably can be dealt with only by systems based on logic and deduction. We further argue that the experiments of the late 1960s on problem-solving by theorem-proving did not show that the use of logic and deduction in AI systems was necessarily inefficient, but rather that what was needed was better control of the deduction process, combined with more attention to the computational properties of axioms.",

ABSTRACT="A major benefit of using natural language to access the information in a database is that it shifts onto the system to burden of mediating between two views of the data: the way in which the data is stored (the ``database view''), and the way in which an end-user thinks about it (the ``user's view''). Database information is recorded in terms of files, records, and fields, while natural-language expressions refer to the same information in terms of entities and relationships in the world. A major problem in constructing a natural-language interface is determining how to encode and use the information needed to bridge these two views. Current natural-language interface systems require extensive efforts by specialists in natural-language processing to provide them with the information they need to do the bridging. The systems are, in effect, handtailored to provide access to particular databases. This paper focuses on the problem of constructing \underline{transportable} natural-language interfaces, i.e., systems that can be adapted to provide access to databases for which they were not specifically handtailored. It describes an initial version of a transportable system, called TEAM (for \underline{T}ransportable \underline{E}nglish \underline{A}ccess Data \underline{M}anager). The hypothesis underlying the research described in this paper is that the information required for the adaptation can be obtained through an interactive dialogue with database management personnel who are not familiar with natural-language processing techniques.",

We broadly define computational stereo as the recovery of the three-dimensional characteristics of a scene from multiple images taken from different points of view. The first part of the paper identifies and discusses each of the functional components of the computational stereo paradigm: image acquisition, camera modeling, feature acquisition, matching, depth determination, and interpolation.

MONTH=mar,
YEAR=1982,
ABSTRACT="This dissertation presents the results of research on a planning formalism for a theory of natural-language generation that will support the generation of utterances that satisfy multiple goals. Previous research in the area of computer generation of natural-language utterances has concentrated two aspects of language production: (1) the process of producing surface syntactic forms from an underlying representation, and (2) the planning of illocutionary acts to satisfy the speaker's goals. This work concentrates on the interaction between these two aspects of language generation and considers the overall problem to be one of refining the specification of an illocutionary act into a surface syntactic form, emphasizing the problems of achieving multiple goals in a single utterance. Planning utterances requires an ability to reason in detail about what the hearer knows and wants. A formalism, based on a possible-worlds semantics of an intentional logic of knowledge and action, was used for representing the effects of illocutionary acts and the speaker's beliefs about the hearer's knowledge of the world. Techniques are described that enable a planning system to use the representation effectively. The language-planning theory and knowledge representation are embodied in a computer system called KAMP (Knowledge and Modalities Planner), which plans both physical and linguistic actions, given a high-level description of the speaker's goals. The research has application to the design of gracefully interacting computer systems, multiple-agent planning systems, and the planning of knowledge acquisition.",

ABSTRACT="This paper presents a method of formally representing the information that is available to a user of a relational database. The intended application area is deductive question-answering systems that must access an existing relational database. To respond intelligently to user inquiries, such systems must have a more complete representation of the domain of discourse than is generally available in the tuple sets of a relational database. Given this more expressive representation, the problem then arises of how to reconcile the information present in the database with the domain representation, so that database queries can be derived to answer the user's inquiries. Here we take the formal approach of describing a relational database as the model of a first-order language. Another first-order language, the metalanguage, is used both to represent the domain of discourse, and to describe the relationship of the database to the domain. The formal advantages of this approach are presented and contrasted with other work in the area.",

ABSTRACT="This paper presents the view that artificial intelligence (AI) is primarily concerned with propositional languages for representing knowledge and with techniques for manipulating these representations. In this respect, AI is analogous to applied mathematics; its representations and techniques can be applied in a variety of other subject areas. Typically, AI research is (or should be) more concerned with the general form and properties of representational languages and methods than it is with the content being described by these languages. Notable exceptions involve ``commonsense'' knowledge about the everyday world (no other specialty claims this subject area as its own), and world (no knowledge about the properties and uses of knowledge itself). In these areas AI is concerned with content as well as form. We also observe that the technology that seems to underlie peripheral sensory and motor activities (analogous to low-level animal or human vision and muscle control) seems to be quite different from the technology that seems to underlie cognitive reasoning and problem solving. Some definitions of AI would include peripheral as well as cognitive processes; here we argue against including the peripheral processes.",

To construct a program whose output satisfies the conditions of the specification, we prove a theorem stating the existence of such an output. The proof is restricted to be sufficiently constructive so that a program computing the desired output can be extracted directly from the proof. The program we obtain is applicative and may consist of several mutually recursive procedures. The proof constitutes a demonstration of the correctness of this program. To exhibit the full power of the deductive approach, we apply it to a nontrivial example--the synthesis of a unification algorithm. Unification is the process of finding a common instance of two expressions. Algorithms to perform unification have been central to many theorem-proving systems and to some programming-language processors. The task of deriving a unification algorithm automatically is beyond the power of existing program synthesis systems. In this paper we use the deductive approach to derive an algorithm from a simple, high-level specification of the unification task. We will identify some of the capabilities required of a theorem-proving system to perform this derivation automatically.",

ABSTRACT="Techniques and tools to assist in several phases of the knowledge-engineering process for developing an expert system are explored. A sophisticated domain-independent network editor is described that uses knowledge about the representational and computational formalisms of the host consultation system to watch over the knowledge-engineering process and to give the knowledge engineer a convenient environment for developing, debugging, and maintaining the knowledge base. We also illustrate how partial matching techniques can assist in maintaining the consistency of the knowledge base (in form and content) as it grows, and can support a variety of features that will enhance the interaction between the system and the user and make a knowledge-based consultation system behave more intelligently. Although these techniques and features are illustrated in terms of the Prospector environment, it will be clear to the reader how these techniques can be applied in other environments.",

ABSTRACT="Most current theories of natural-language processing propose that the assimilation of an utterance involves producing an expression or structure that in some sense represents the literal meaning of the utterance. It is often maintained that understanding what an utterance literally means consists in being able to recover such a representation. In philosophy and linguistics this sort of representation is usually said to display the \underline{logical form} of an utterance. This paper surveys some of the key problems that arise in defining a system of representation for the logical forms of English sentences and suggests possible approaches to their solution. We first look at some general issues relating to the notion of logical form, explaining why it makes sense to define such a notion only for sentences in context, not in isolation, and we discuss the relationship between research on logical form and work on knowledge representation in artificial intelligence. The rest of the paper is devoted to examining specific problems in logical form. These include the following: quantifiers; events, actions and processes; time and space; collective entities and substances; propositional attitudes and modalities; questions and imperatives.",

ABSTRACT="How to enable computers to draw conclusions automatically from bodies of facts has long been recognized as a central problem in artificial-intelligence (AI) research. Any attempt to address this problem requires choosing an application (or type of application), a representation for bodies of facts, and methods for deriving conclusions. This article provides an overview of the issues involved in drawing conclusions by means of deductive inference from bodies of commonsense knowledge represented by logical formulas. We first briefly review the history of this enterprise: its origins, its fall into disfavor, and its recent revival. We show why applications involving certain types of incomplete information resist solution by other techniques, and how supplying domain-specific control information seems to offer a solution to the difficulties that previously led to disillusionment with automatic deduction. Finally, we discuss the relationship of automatic deduction to the new field of ``logic programming,'' and we survey some of the issues that arise in extending automatic-deduction techniques to nonstandard logics.",

ABSTRACT="We are interested in constructing a computer agent whose behavior will be intelligent enough to perform cooperative tasks involving other agents like itself. The construction of such agents has been a major goal of artificial intelligence research. One of the key tasks such an agent must perform is to form plans to carry out its intentions in a complex world in which other planning agents also exist. To construct such agents, it will be necessary to address a number of issues that concern the interaction of knowledge, actions, and planning. Briefly stated, an agent at planning time must take into account what his future states of knowledge will be if he is to form plans that he can execute; and if he must incorporate the plans of other agents into his own, then he must also be able to reason about the knowledge and plans of other agents in an appropriate way. These ideas have been explored by several researchers, especially McCarthy and Hayes [McCarthy and Hayes, 1969] and Moore [Moore 1980]. Despite the importance of this problem, there has not been a great deal of work in the area of formalizing a solution. Formalisms for both action and knowledge separately have been examined in some depth, but there have been few attempts at a synthesis. The exception to this is Moore's thesis on reasoning about knowledge and action [Moore 1980], for which a planner has been recently proposed [Appelt 1980]. Moore shows how a formalism based on possible-world semantics can be used to reason about the interaction of knowledge and action. In this paper we develop an alternative formalism for reasoning about knowledge, belief, and action; we show how this formalism can be used to deal with several well-known problems, and then describe how it could be used by a plan constructing systems.",

ABSTRACT="Several computer systems have now been constructed that allow users to access databases by posing questions in natural languages, such as English. When used in the restricted domains for which they have been especially designed, these systems have achieved reasonably high levels of performance. However, these systems require the encoding of knowledge about the domain of application in complex data structures that typically can be created for a new database only with considerable effort on the part of a computer professional who has had special training in computational linguistics and the use of databases. This paper describes initial work on a methodology for creating natural-language processing capabilities for new databases without the need for intervention by specially trained experts. The approach is to acquire logical schemata and lexical information through simple interactive dialogues with someone who is familiar with the form and content of the database, but unfamiliar with the technology of natural-language interfaces. A prototype system using this methodology is described and an example transcript is presented.",

We have been especially interested in exploring the notion of simultaneously learning not only new concepts, but also the linguistic constructions used to express those concepts. As a research vehicle we have developed a system that is preprogrammed with deductive algorithms and a fixed set of syntactic/semantic rules covering a small subset of English. It has been endowed with sufficient seen concepts and seed vocabulary to support effective tutorial interaction. Furthermore, the system is capable of learning new concepts and vocabulary, and can apply its acquired knowledge in a range of problem-solving situations.",

ABSTRACT="Certain features of programming languages, such as data structure operations and procedure call mechanisms, have been found to resist formalization by classical techniques. An alternate approach is presented, based on a ``situational calculus,'' which makes explicit reference to the states of a computation. For each state, a distinction is drawn between an expression, its value, and the location of the value. Within this conceptual framework, the features of a programming language can be described axiomatically. Programs in the language can then be synthesized, executed, verified, or transformed by performing deductions in this axiomatic system. Properties of entire classes of programs, and of programming languages, can also be expressed and proved in this way. The approach is amenable to machine implementation. In a situational-calculus formalism it is possible to model precisely many ``problematic'' features of programming languages, including operations on such data structures as arrays, pointers, lists, and records, and such procedure call mechanisms as call-by-reference, call-by-value, and call-by-name. No particular obstacle is presented by aliasing between variables, by declarations, or by recursive procedures. The paper is divided into three parts, focusing respectively on the assignment statement, on data structure operations, and on procedure call mechanisms. In this first part, we introduce the conceptual framework to be applied throughout and present the axiomatic definition of the assignment statement. If suitable restrictions on the programming language are imposed, the well-known Hoare assignment axiom can then be proved as a theorem. However, our definition can also describe the assignment statement of unrestricted programming languages, for which the Hoare axiom does not hold.",

The second approach to discourse applies work on planning to the planning of individual speech acts and to the plans speakers develop for effecting their goals in larger stretches of conversation. In this paper we first outline how we apply these approaches to the ethnographic data. We discuss three kinds of coherence in terms of which we analyze a text, and then describe our method more generally. We next give an example of the method of microanalysis on a short fragment of an interview, and then show how the beliefs, goals and concerns that the microanalysis has revealed are tied in with the rest of the corpus.

ABSTRACT="Interpolating smooth surfaces from boundary conditions is a ubiquitous problem in early visual processing. We describe a solution for an important special case: the interpolation of surfaces that are locally spherical or cylindrical from initial orientation values and constraints on orientation. The approach exploits an observation that components of the unit normal vary linearly on surfaces of uniform curvature, which permits implementation using local parallel processes. Experiments on spherical and cylindrical test cases have produced essentially exact reconstructions, even when boundary values were extremely sparse or only partially constrained. Results on other test cases seem in reasonable agreement with human perception.",

MONTH=apr,
YEAR=1980,
ABSTRACT="This paper addresses problems associated with accessing elements of large multidimensional arrays when the order of access is either unpredictable or is orthogonal to the conventional order of array storage. Large arrays are defined as arrays that are larger than the physical memory immediately available to store them. Such arrays must be accessed either by the virtual memory system of the computer and operating system, or by direct input and output of blocks of the array to a file system. In either case, the direct result of an inappropriate order of reference to the elements of the array is the very time-consuming movement of data between levels in the memory hierarchy, often costing factors of three orders of magnitude in algorithm performance. The access to elements of large arrays is decomposed into three steps: transforming the subscript values of an n-dimensional array into the element number in a one-dimensional virtual array, mapping the virtual array position to physical memory position, and accessing the array element in physical memory. The virtual-to-physical mapping step is unnecessary on computer systems with sufficiently large virtual address spaces. This paper is primarily concerned with the first step. A subscript transformation is proposed that solves many of the order-of-access problems associated with conventional array storage. This transformation is based on an additive decomposition of the calculation of element number in the array into the sum of a set of integer functions applied to the set of subscripts as follows: \begin{center} element-number(i,j,...) = fi(i) + fj(j) + ... \end{center} Choices for the transformation functions that minimize access time to the array elements depend on the characteristics of the computer system's memory hierarchy and the order of accesses to the array elements. It is conjectured that given appropriate models for system and algorithm access characteristics, a pragmatically optimum choice can be made for the subscript transformation functions. In general these models must be stochastic, but in certain cases deterministic models are possible. Using tables to evaluate the functions fi and fj makes implementation very efficient with conventional computers. When the array accesses are made in an order inappropriate to conventional array storage order, this scheme requires far less time than for conventional array-accessing schemes; otherwise, accessing times are comparable. The semantics of a set of procedures for array access, array creation, and the association of arrays with file names is defined. For computer systems with insufficient virtual memory, such as the PDP-10, a software virtual-to-physical mapping scheme is given in Appendix C. Implementations are also given in the appendix for the VAX and PDP-10 series computers to access pixels of large images stored as two-dimensional arrays of n bits per element.",

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and thus is ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, we derive new results on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and present algorithms for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing and analysis conditions. Implementation details and computational examples are also presented.",

Major concerns were the ability to interpret and respond to utterances within the dynamic environment effected by progress in the task, as well as by the concommitant shifting dialog context. The research strategy followed was to determine the kinds of knowledge needed, to define formalisms for encoding them and procedures for reasoning with them, to implement those formalisms and procedures in a computer system called TDUS, and then to test them by exercising the system. Principal accomplishments include: development of a framework for encoding knowledge about linguistic processes; encoding of a grammar for recognizing many of the syntactic structures of English; development of the concept of ``focusing,'' which clarifies a major role of context; development of a formalism for representing knowledge about processes, and procedures for reasoning about them; development of an overall framework for describing how different types of knowledge interact in the communication process; development of a computer system that not only demonstrates the feasibility of the various formalisms and procedures, but also provides a research tool for testing new hypotheses about the communication process.",

Knowledge of the language, knowledge about the general subject being discussed, and knowledge about the current situation are all necessary for this. The problem of determining an action referred to by a verb phrase is analogous to the problem of determining the object referred to by a noun phrase. This paper presents an approach to the problems of verb phrases resolution in which knowledge about language, the problem domain, and the dialog itself is combined to interpret such references. Presented and discussed are the kinds of knowledge necessary for interpreting references to actions, as well as algorithms for using that knowledge in interpreting dialog utterances about ongoing tasks and for drawing inferences about the task situation that are based on a given interpretation.",

YEAR=1980,
ABSTRACT="This paper presents an explanatory overview of a large and complex grammar, DIAGRAM, that is used in a computer system for interpreting English dialogue. DIAGRAM analyzes all of the basic kinds of phrases and sentences and many quite complex ones as well. It is not tied to a particular domain of application, and it can be extended to analyze additional constructions, using the formalism in which it is currently written. For every expression it analyzes, DIAGRAM provides an annotated description of the structural relations holding among its constituents. The annotations provide important information for other parts of the system that interpret the expression in the context of a dialogue. DIAGRAM is an augmented phrase structure grammar. Its rule procedures allow phrases to inherit attributes from their constituents and to acquire attributes from the larger phrases in which they themselves are constituents. Consequently, when these attributes are used to set context-sensitive constraints on the acceptance of an analysis, the contextual constraints can be imposed by conditions on dominance as well as conditions on constituency. Rule procedures can also assign scores to an analysis, rating some applications of a rule as probable or as unlikely. Less likely analyses can be ignored by the procedures that interpret the utterance. In assigning categories and writing the rule statements and procedures for DIAGRAM, decisions were guided by consideration of the functions that phrases serve in communication as well as by considerations of efficiency in relating syntactic analyses to propositional content. The major decisions are explained and illustrated with examples of the rules and the analyses they provide. Some contrasts with transformational grammars are pointed out and problems that motivate a plan to use redundancy rules in the future are discussed. (Redundancy rules are meta-rules that derive new constituent-structure rules from a set of base rules, thereby achieving generality of syntactic statement without having to perform transformations on syntactic analyses.) Other extensions of both grammar and formalism are projected in the concluding section. Appendices provide details and samples of the lexicon, the rule statements, and the procedures, as well as analyses for several sentences that differ in type and structure.",

ABSTRACT="Perhaps the most promising working hypothesis for the study of conversation is that the participants can be viewed as using planning mechanisms much like those developed in artificial intelligence. In this paper, a framework for investigating conversation, which for convenience will be called the Planning Approach, is developed from this hypothesis. It suggests a style of analysis to apply to conversation, analysis in terms of the participants' goals, plans, and beliefs, and it indicates a consequent program of research to be pursued. These are developed in detail in Part 2. Parts 3 and 4 are devoted to the microanalysis of an actual free-flowing conversation, as an illustration of the style of analysis. In the process, order is discovered in a conversation that on the surface seems quite incoherent. The microanalysis suggests some ways in which the planning mechanisms common in artificial intelligence will have to be extended to deal with conversation, and these are discussed in Part 5. In Part 6, certain methodological difficulties are examined. Part 7 addresses the problem that arises in this approach of what constitutes successful communication.",

The approach is based on a new paradigm for combining local information from multiple, and possibly incommensurate, sources, including various line and edge detection operators, map knowledge about the likely path of roads through an image, and generic knowledge about roads (e.g., connectivity, curvature, and width constraints). The final interpretation of the scene is achieved by using either a graph search or dynamic programming technique to optimize a global figure of merit.

Text processors are viewed as systems that model both a theory of text and a theory of information processing. The interdisciplinary research required to design such systems have a common center, conceptually, in the development of new kinds of lexical information, since words are not only linguistics objects, they are also psychological objects that evoke experiences from which meanings can be inferred. Recent developments in linguistic theory seem likely to promote more fruitful cooperation and integration of linguistic research with research on test processing.",

ABSTRACT="A map-guided approach to interpretation of remotely sensed imagery is described, with emphasis on applications involving continuous monitoring of predetermined ground sites. Geometric correspondence between a sensed image and a symbolic reference map is established in an initial stage of processing by adjusting parameters of a sensor model so that image features predicted from the map optimally match corresponding features extracted from the sensed image. Information in the map is then used to constrain where to look in an image and what to look for. With such constraints, previously intractable remote sensing tasks can become feasible, even easy, to automate. Four illustrative examples are given, involving the monitoring of reservoirs, roads, railroad yards, and harbors.",

ABSTRACT="This thesis deals with the problem of making a computer reason about the interactions between knowledge and action. In particular, we want to be able to reason about what knowledge a person must have in order to perform an action, and what knowledge a person may gain by performing an action. The first problem we face in achieving this goal is that the basic facts about knowledge which we need to use are most naturally expressed as a modal logic. There are, however, no known techniques for efficiently doing automatic deduction directly in modal logics. We solve this problem by taking the possible-world semantics for a modal logic of knowledge and axiomatizing it directly in first-order logic. This means that we reason not about what facts someone knows, but rather what possible worlds are compatible with what identifying possible worlds with the situations before and after an action is performed. We use these notions to express what knowledge a person must have in order to perform a given action and what knowledge a person acquires by carrying out a given action. Finally, we consider some domain-specific control heuristics that are useful for doing deductions in this formalism, and we present several examples of deductions produced by applying these heuristics.",

ABSTRACT="When two people talk, they focus their attention on only a small portion of what each of them knows or believes. Both what is said and how it is interpreted depend on a shared understanding of this narrowing of attention to a small highlighted portion of what is known. Focusing is an active process. As a dialogue progresses, the participants continually shift their focus and thus form an evolving context against which utterances are produced and understood. A speaker provides a hearer with clues of what to look at and how to look at it--what to focus on, how to focus on it, and how wide or narrow the focusing should be. As a result, one of the effects of understanding an utterance is that the listener becomes focused on certain entities (both objects and relationships) from a particular perspective. Focusing clues may be linguistic or they may come from knowledge about the relationships between entities in the domain. Linguistic clues may be either explicit, deriving directly from certain words, or implicit, deriving from sentential structure and from rhetorical relationships between sentences. This paper examines the relationships between focusing and definite descriptions in dialogue and its implications for natural language processing systems. It describes focusing mechanisms based on domain structure clues which have been included in a computer system and, from this perspective, indicates future research problems entailed in modeling the focusing process more generally.",

Generic models may be described that may leave some parameters or dimensions unspecified, so that when a specific instance of the model is described, those parameters may either be explicitly specified or take on default values.

ABSTRACT="When people produce a discourse, what needs are they responding to when they make it coherent, and what form does this coherence take? In this paper, it is argued that coherence can be characterized in terms of a set of ``coherence relations'' between segments of a discourse. It is shown, from an abstract description of the discourse situation, that these relations correspond to the kinds of communicative work that needs to get done in discourse. In particular, four requirements for successful communication are isolated: the message itself must be conveyed; the message must be related to the goals of the discourse; what is new and unpredictable in the message must be related to what the listener's inference processes toward the full intended meaning of the message. Corresponding to each requirement is a class of coherence relations that help the speaker satisfy the requirements. The coherence relations in each class are discussed and defined formally. Finally, a fragment of a conversation is analyzed in detail to illustrate the problems that face a speaker in trying to satisfy these requirements, and to demonstrate the role the coherence relations play in the solution.",

ABSTRACT="Most current industrial vision systems are designed to recognize known objects seen from standard view points in high contrast scenes. Their performance and reliability are marginal; many tasks including such as bin picking, recognition of parts on overhead conveyors, and implicit inspection of surface flaws are beyond current competence. Recent image understanding research suggests that the limitations of current industrial vision systems stem from inadequate representations for describing scenes; physical attributes (reflectance, texture, etc.) and three-dimensional pictorial features and object models. This paper builds a case for needed additional levels of representation and outlines the design of a general-purpose computer-vision system capable of high performance in a wide variety of industrial vision tasks. This paper was originally presented at the General Motors Symposium on ``Computer Vision and Sensor-Based Robots,'' September 1978, the proceedings of which will be published by Plenum Press in 1979.",

ABSTRACT="A scene-analysis approach to interpretation of remotely sensed imagery is described, with emphasis on applications involving continuous monitoring of predetermined ground sites. A key concept is the use of knowledge contained in various kinds of maps to guide the extraction of relevant information from the image. Geometric correspondence between a sensed image and a symbolic map is established in an initial stage of processing by adjusting parameters of a sensor model so that image features predicted from the optimally match corresponding features extracted from the sensed image. Information in the map is then used to constrain where to look in an image, what to look for, and how to interpret what is seen. For simple monitoring tasks involving multispectral classification, these constraints can significantly reduce computation, simplify interpretation, and improve the utility of the resulting information. Moreover, previously intractable tasks requiring spatial and textural analysis may become straightforward in the context established by the map knowledge. Three such tasks are demonstrated: monitoring the volume of water in a reservoir, monitoring the number of boxcars in a rail yard, and monitoring the number of ships in a harbor. The conceptual approach of map-guided image analysis is described in sufficient generality to suggest numerous other applications. Details of the map-image correspondence procedure and a general technique for locating boundaries to subpixel accuracy using map knowledge are described in appendices.",

ABSTRACT="Coherence in conversations and in texts can be partially characterized by a set of coherence relations, motivated ultimately by the speaker's or writer's need to be understood. In this paper, formal definitions are given for several coherence relations, based on the operations of an inference system; that is, the relations between successive portions of a discourse are characterized in terms of the inferences that can be drawn from each. In analyzing a discourse, it is frequently the case that we would recognize it as coherent, in that it would satisfy the formal definition of some coherence relation, if only we could assume certain noun phrases to be coreferential. In such cases, we will simply assume the identity of the entities referred to, in what might be called a ``petty conversational implicature,'' thereby solving the coherence and coreference problems simultaneously. Three examples of different kinds of reference problems are presented. In each, it is shown how the coherence of the discourse are solved, almost as a by-product, by means of these petty conversational implicatures.",

ABSTRACT="We suggest that an appropriate role of early visual processing is to describe a scene in terms of intrinsic (vertical) characteristics--such as range, orientation, reflectance, and incident illumination--of the surface element visible at each point in the image. Support for this idea comes from three sources: the obvious utility of intrinsic characteristics for higher-level scene analysis; the apparent ability of humans to determine these characteristics, regardless of viewing conditions or familiarity with the scene; and a theoretical argument that such a description is obtainable, by a noncognitive and nonpurposive process, at least, for simple scene domains. The central problem in recovering intrinsic value encodes all the characteristics of the corresponding scene point. Recovery depends on exploiting constraints, derived from assumptions about the nature of the scene and the physics of the imaging process.",

ABSTRACT="Deductive techniques are presented for deriving programs systematically from given specifications. The specifications express the purpose of the desired program without giving any hint of the algorithm to be employed. The basic approach is to transform the specifications repeatedly according to certain rules, until a satisfactory program is produced. These techniques have been incorporated in a running program-synthesis system, called DEDALUS. Many of the transformation rules represent knowledge about the program's subject domain (e.g., numbers, lists, sets); some represent the meaning of the constructs of the specification language and the target programming language; and a few rules represent basic programming principles. Two of these principles, the conditional-formation rule and the recursion-formation rule, account for the introduction of conditional expressions and of recursive calls into the synthesized program. The termination of the programs is ensured as new recursive calls are formed. Two extensions of the recursion-formation rule are discussed; a procedure-formation rule, which admits the introduction of auxiliary subroutines in the course of the synthesis process, and a generalization rule, which causes the specifications to be altered to represent a more general problem that is nevertheless easier to solve. Special techniques are introduced for the formation of programs with side effects. The techniques of this paper are illustrated with a sequence of examples of increasing complexity; programs are constructed for list processing, numerical calculation, and array computation. The methods of program synthesis can be applied to various aspects of programming methodology--program transformation, data abstraction, program modification, and structured programming. The DEDALUS system accepts specifications expressed in a high-level language, including set notation, logical quantification, and a rich vocabulary drawn from a variety of subject domains. The system attempts to transform the specifications into a recursive, LISP-like target program. Over one hundred rules have been implemented, each expressed as a small program in a QLISP language.",

Focus of attention is essential to any comprehension process because what and how a person understands is strongly influenced by where his attention is directed at a given moment. To formalize the notion of focus, the need for and the use of focus mechanisms are considered from the standpoint of building a computer system that can participate in a natural language dialogue with a user. Two ranges of focus, global and immediate, are investigated, and representations for incorporating them in a computer system as developed. The global focus in which an utterance is interpreted is determined by the total discourse and situational setting of the utterance. It influences what is talked about, how different concepts are introduced, and how concepts are referenced. To encode global focus computationally, a representation is developed that highlights those items that are relevant at a given place in a dialogue. The underlying knowledge representation is segmented into subunits, called focus spaces, that contain those items that are in the focus of attention of a dialogue participant during a particular part of the dialogue. Mechanisms are required for updating the focus representation, because, as a dialogue progresses, the objects and actions that are relevant to the conversation, and therefore in the participants' focus of attention, change. Procedures are described for deciding when and how to shift focus in task-oriented dialogues, i.e., in dialogues in which the participants are cooperating in a shared task. These procedures are guided by a representation of the task being performed. The ability to represent focus of attention in a language understanding system results in a new approach to an important problem in discourse comprehension--the identification of the referents of definite noun phrases. Procedures for identifying referents are developed that take discourse structure into account and use the distinction between highlighted items and those that are not highlighted to constrain the search for the referent of a definite noun phrase. Interpretation of an utterance also depends on the immediate focus established by the linguistic form of the preceding utterance. The interpretation of elliptical sentence fragments illustrates the effect of immediate focus. Procedures that interpret elliptical sentence fragments are developed. The use of a representation that superimposes syntactic information about an utterance on the interpretation of the underlying meaning of that utterance to minimize the processing required to expand a fragment into a complete sentence.",

ABSTRACT="A new predicate calculus deduction system based on production rules is proposed. The system combines several developments in Artificial Intelligence and Automatic Theorem Proving research including the use of domain-specific inference rules and separate mechanisms for forward and backward reasoning. It has a clean separation between the data base, the production rules, and the control system. Goals and subgoals are maintained in an AND/OR tree structure. We introduce here a structure that is the dual of the AND/OR tree to represent assertions. The production rules modify these structures until they ``connect'' in a fashion that proves the goal theorem. Unlike some previous systems that used production rules, ours is not limited to rules in Horn Clause form. Unlike previous PLANNER-like systems, ours can handle the full range of predicate calculus expressions including those with quantified variables, disjunctions and negations.",

ABSTRACT="We describe a knowledge representation scheme called K-NET and a problem solving system called SNIFFER designed to answer queries using a K-NET knowledge base. K-NET uses a partitioned semantic net to combine the expressive capabilities of the first-order predicate calculus with linkage to procedural knowledge and with full indexing of objects to the relationships in which they participate. Facilities are also included for representing taxonomies of sets and for maintaining hierarchies of contexts. SNIFFER is a manager and coordinator of deductive and problem-solving processes. The basic system includes a logically complete set of natural deduction facilities that do not require statements to be converted into clause or prenex normal form. Using SNIFFER's coroutine-based control structure, alternative proofs may be constructed in pseudo-parallel and results shared among them. In addition, SNIFFER can also manage application of specialist procedures that have specific knowledge about a particular domain or about the topology of the K-NET structures. For example, specialist procedures are used to manipulate taxonomic information and to link the system to information in external data bases.",

ABSTRACT="IDA was developed at SRI to allow a casual user to retrieve information from a data base, knowing the fields present in the data base, but not the structure of the data base itself. IDA is part of a system that allows the user to express queries in a restricted subset of English, about a data base of fourteen files stored on CCA's Datacomputer. IDA's input is a very simple, formal query language which is essentially a list of restrictions on fields and queries about fields, with no mention of the structure of the data base. It produces a series of DBMS queries, which are transmitted over the ARPA network. The results of these queries are combined by IDA to provide the answer to the user's query. In this paper, we will define the input language, and give examples of IDA's behavior. We will also present our representation of the ``structural schema,'' which is the information needed by IDA to know how the data base is actually organized. We will give an idea of some of the heuristics which are used to produce a program in the language of the DBMS. Finally, we will discuss the limitations of this approach, as well as future research areas.",

ABSTRACT="This paper reports the author's results in designing, implementing, and testing a framework for a speech-understanding system. The work was done as part of a multi-disciplinary effort based on state-of-the-art advances in computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, systems programming, and speech science. The overall project goal was to develop one or more computer systems that would recognize continuous speech uttered in the context or some well-specified task by making extensive use of grammatical, semantic, and and contextual constraints. We call a system emphasizing such linguistic constraints a `speech-understanding system' to distinguish it from speech-recognition systems which rely on acoustic information alone. Two major aspects of a framework for speech understanding are integration of the process of forming a unified system out of the collection of components--and control--the dynamic direction of the overall activity of the system during the processing of an input utterance. Our method of system integration gives a central role to the input-language definition, which is based on augmented phrase-structure rules. A rule consists of a phrase-structure declaration which specifies the possible for computing 'attributes' and `factors.' Attribute statements determine the properties of particular phrases constructed by the rule; factor statements make acceptability judgments on phrases. Together these statements contain specifications for most of the potential interactions among system components. Our approach to system control centers on a system `Executive' applying the rules of the language definition organizing hypotheses and results, and assigning priorities. Phrases with their attributes and factors are the basic entities manipulated by the Executive, which takes on the role of a parser in carrying out its integration and control functions. The Executive controls the overall activity of the system by setting priorities on the basis of acoustics and linguistic acceptability judgments. These data are combined to form scores and ratings. A phrase score reflects a quality judgment independent of the phrase's context and gives useful local information concerning the sentential context. To get early and efficient access to the contextual information, we have developed a technique for calculating phrase ratings by a heuristic search of possible interpretations that would use the phrase. One of our experiments shows that this context-checking method results in significant improvements in system performance.",

ABSTRACT="Rule-based inference systems allow judgmental knowledge about a specific problem domain to be represented as a collection of discrete rules. Each rule states that if certain premises are known, then certain conclusions can be inferred. An important design issue concerns the representational form for the premises and conclusions of the rules. We describe a rule-based system that uses a partitioned semantic network representation for the premises and conclusions. Several advantages can be cited for the semantic network representation. The most important of these concern the ability to represent subset and element taxonomic information, the ability to include the potential for smooth interface with natural language subsystems. This representation is being used in a system currently under development at SRI to aid a geologist in the evaluation of the mineral potential of exploration sites. The principles behind this system and its current implementation are described in the paper.",

Each combination of choices was tested with 60 simulated utterances of lengths varying from 0.8 to 2.3 seconds. The results include analysis of the effects and interactions of the design choices with respect to aspects of system performance such as overall sentence accuracy, processing time, and storage.

ABSTRACT="This paper explores a technique for proving the correctness and termination of programs simultaneously. This approach, which we call the intermittent-assertion method, involves documenting the program with assertions that must be true at some time when control is passing through the corresponding point, but that need not be true every time. The method, introduced by Knuth and further developed by Burstall, promises to provide a valuable complement to the more conventional methods. We first introduce and illustrate the technique with a number of examples. We then show that a correctness proof using the invariant assertion method or the subgoal induction method can always be expressed using intermittent assertions instead, but that the reverse is not always the case. The method can also be used just to prove termination, and any proof of termination using the conventional well-founded sets approach can be rephrased as a proof using intermittent assertions. Finally, we show how the method can be applied to prove the validity of program transformations and the correctness of continuously operating programs.",

ABSTRACT="One of the most time-consuming and labor-intensive steps in map production involves the delineation of cartographic and cultural features such as lakes, rivers, roads, and drainages in aerial photographs. These features are usually traced manually on a digitizing table in painstaking detail. This paper investigates an alternative approach, an interactive graphically designates a feature of interest by pointing at or crudely tracing it with a display cursor. Using this input as a guide, the system employs context-dependent, scene-analysis techniques to extract a detailed outline of the feature. The results are displayed so that errors can be corrected by further interaction, for example, by tracing small sections of the boundary in detail. This interactive approach appears applicable to many other problem domains involving large quantities of graphic or pictorial data, which are difficult to extract in digital form by either strictly manual or strictly automatic means.",

ABSTRACT="The general problem of drawing inferences from uncertain or incomplete evidence has invited a variety of technical approaches, some mathematically rigorous and some largely informal and intuitive. Most current inference systems in artificial intelligence have emphasized intuitive methods, because the absence of adequate statistical samples forces a reliance on the subjective judgment of human experts. We describe in this paper a subjective Bayesian inference method that realizes some of the advantages of both formal and informal approaches. Of particular interest are the modifications needed to deal with the inconsistencies usually found in collections of subjective statements.",

ABSTRACT="This paper presents a new approach for integrating the segmentation and interpretation phases of scene analysis. Knowledge from a variety of sources is used to make inferences about the interpretations of regions, and regions are merged in accordance with their possible interpretations. The deduction of region interpretations is performed using a generalization of Waltz's filtering algorithm. Deduction proceeds by eliminating possible region interpretations that are not consistent with any possible interpretation of an adjacent region. Different sources of knowledge are expressed uniformly as constraints on the possible interpretations of regions. Multiple sources of knowledge can thus be combined in a straightforward way such that incremental additions of knowledge (or equivalently, human guidance) will effect incremental improvements in performance. Experimental results are reported in three scene domains, landscapes, mechanical equipment, and rooms, using, respectively, a human collaborator, a geometric model and a set of relational constraints as sources of knowledge. These experiments demonstrate that segmentation is much improved when integrated computational overhead over unguided segmentation. Applications of the approach in cartography, photointerpretation, vehicle guidance, medicine, and motion picture analysis are suggested.",

ABSTRACT="MSYS is a system for reasoning with uncertain information and inexact rules of inference. Its major application, to date, has been to the interpretation of visual features (such as regions) in scene analysis. In this application, features are assigned sets of possible interpretations with associated likelihoods based on local attributes (e.g., color, size, and shape). Interpretations are related by rules of inference that adjust the likelihoods up or down in accordance with interpretation likelihoods of related features. An asynchronous relaxation process repeatedly applies the rules until a consistent set of likelihood values is attained. At this point, several alternative interpretations still exist for each feature. One feature is chosen and the most likely of its alternatives is assumed. the rules are then used in this more precise context to determine likelihoods for the interpretations of remaining features by a further round of relaxation. The selection and relaxation steps are repeated until all features have been interpreted. Some interpretation typifies constraint optimization problems involving the assignment of values to a set of mutually constrained variables. For an interesting class of constraints, MSYS is guaranteed to find the optimal solution with less branching than conventional heuristic search methods. MSYS is implemented as a network of asynchronous parallel processes. The implementation provides an effective way of using data driven systems with distributed control for optimal stochastic search.",

ABSTRACT="This report describes a computer program that approaches perception as a problem-solving task. The system uses information about the appearances of objects, about their interrelationships, and about available sensors to produce a plan for locating specified objects in images of room scenes. The strategies produced allow for cost-effective processing by utilizing ``cheap'' features in the early stages, reserving more complex operations for later in the process, when the content has been sufficiently restricted. The general strategy paradigm used by the system is to acquire image samples expected to belong to the target object; validate the hypothesis that the acquired samples do belong to the target; and finally to bound the image of the object by outlining it in a display picture. Sensors used by the system include a vidicon with three color filters and a master-scanned, laser-rangefinder capable of producing a ``range image.'' In addition, the range-finder measures the reflectivity at the laser wavelength, at each post, producing a gray-scale image in perfect registration with the range image. The primitive attributes of brightness, line, saturation, height, and local surface orientation at specified range locations can be computed from these images. These attributes represent the new data available to the system for recognizing and identifying objects. Object descriptions are provided initially by indicating the object to the system, and allowing the system to measure attributes. Other data, such as typical object relationships, are provided interactively by the user. When required to locate an object, the system computes a distinguishing features representation that will serve to separate parts of the target from those of other objects. These distinguishing features are combined into a strategy represented as a planning graph. This graph contains optimal subgoals for achieving the goal of locating the object. An execution routine selects the ``best'' subgoal, executes it, rates its effect, and selects the next best goal, continuing with the progress until either the object is located, or there are no options remaining. This approach offers several contributions to perception research. By capitalizing on the goal-directed aspects of the problem, the system is able to select relevant information from a mass of irrelevant data. The system is able to organize its processing in such a way as to optimize the use of sensor data. By generating strategies when needed, the program allows for the easy introduction of new objects and new sensors. The system allows for the logical introduction of new information deriving algorithms.",

ABSTRACT="This report describes progress that has been made in the ability of a computer system to understand and reason actions. A new method for representing actions within a computer memory has been developed, and this new representation, called the procedural net, has been employed in developing new strategies for solving problems and monitoring the execution of the resulting solutions. A set of running computer programs, called the NOAH (Nets of Action Hierarchies) systems, embodies the representation and strategies discussed above. Its major goal is to provide a framework for storing expertise about the actions of a particular task domain and to impart that expertise to a human in the cooperative achievement of nontrivial tasks. A problem is presented to NOAH as a statement that is to be made true by applying a sequence of actions in an initial state of the world. The actions are drawn from a set of actions previously defined to the system. NOAH first creates a one-step solution to the problem (essentially ``Solve the given goal''). Then it progressively expands the level of detail of the solution, filling in ever more detailed actions. All the individual actions, composed into plans at differing levels of detail, are stored in a data structure called the procedural net. The system avoids imposing unnecessary constraints on the order of the actions, rather than as linear sequences. The same data structure is used to guide the human user through a task. Since the system has planned the task at varying levels of detail, it can issue requests for action to the user at varying levels of detail, depending on his competence and understanding of the higher-level actions. If more detail should be needed than was originally planned for, or if an unexpected event causes the plan to go awry, the system can continue to plan from any point during execution. The key ideas that are explored include: \begin{enumerate} \item Planning at many levels of detail \item Representing a plan as a partial ordering of actions with respect to time. \item Execution monitoring and error recovery using hierarchical plans. \item Using procedures that represent a task domain to generate declarative (frame-like) structures that represent individual actions. \item Using abstract actions to model iterative operators. \end{enumerate} The major point of the report is that the structure of a plan of actions is as important for problem solving and execution monitoring as the nature of the actions themselves.",

ABSTRACT="In the synthesis of a plan or computer program, the problem of achieving several goals simultaneously presents special difficulties, since a plan to achieve one goal may interfere with attaining the others. This paper develops the following strategy: to achieve two goals simultaneously, develop a plan to achieve one of them and then modify that plan to achieve the second as well. A systematic program modification technique is presented to support this strategy. The technique requires the introduction of a special ``skeleton model'' to represent a changing world that can accommodate modifications in the plan. This skeleton model also provides a novel approach to the ``frame problem.'' The strategy is illustrated by its application to three examples. Two examples involve synthesizing the following programs: interchanging the values of two variables and sorting three variables. The third entails formulating a tricky blocks world plan. The strategy has been implemented in a simple QLISP program. It is argued that skeleton modeling is valuable as a planning technique apart from its use in plan modification, particularly because it facilitates the representation of ``influential actions'' whose effects may be far reaching. The second part of the paper is a critical survey of contemporary planning literature, which compares our approach with other techniques for facing the same problems.",

An automatic program synthesis system must combine reasoning and programming ability with a good deal of knowledge about the subject matter of the program. This ability and knowledge must be manifested both procedurally (by programs) and structurally (by choice of representation). We describe some of the reasoning and programming capabilities of a projected synthesis system. Special attention is paid to the introduction of conditional tests, loops, and instructions with wide effects in the program being constructed. The ability to satisfy several interacting goals simultaneously proves to be important in many contexts. The modification of an already existing program to solve a somewhat different problem has been found to be a powerful approach. We illustrate these concepts with hand simulations of the synthesis of a number of pattern-matching programs. Some of these techniques have already been implemented, some are in the course of implementation, while others seem equivalent to well-known unsolved problems in artificial intelligence.",

ABSTRACT="This paper describes a theorem prover that embodies knowledge about programming constructs, such as numbers, arrays, lists, and expressions. The program can reason about these concepts and is used as part of a program verification system that uses the Floyd-Naur explication of program semantics. It is implemented in the QA4 language; the QA4 system allows many pieces of strategic knowledge, each expressed as a small program, to be coordinated so that a program stands forward when it is relevant to the problem at hand. The language allows clear, concise representation of this sort of knowledge. The QA4 system also has special facilities for dealing with commutative functions, ordering relations, and equivalence relations; these features are heavily used in this deductive system. The program interrogates the user and asks his advice in the course of a proof. Verifications have been found for Hoare's FIND program a real-number division algorithm, and some sort programs, as well as for many simpler algorithms. Additional theorems have been proved about a pattern matcher and a version of Robinson's unification algorithm. The appendix contains a complete, annotated listing of the deductive system and annotated traces of several of the deductions performed by the system.",

ABSTRACT="This report presents a language, called QA4, designed to facilitate the construction of problem-solving systems used for robot planning, theorem proving, and automatic program synthesis and verification. QA4 integrates an omega-order logic language with canonical composition, associative retrieval, and pattern matching of expressions; process-structure programming; goal-directed searching; and demons. Thus it provides many useful programming aids. More importantly, however, it provides a semantic framework for common sense reasoning about these problem domains. The interpreter for the language is extraordinary general, and is therefore an adaptable tool for developing the specialized techniques of intuitive, symbolic reasoning used by the intelligence system. Chapter One is an informal introduction to the unusual programming concepts available in the QA4 language. Chapter Two is a primer for the language. It informally presents the language through the use of examples. Most of the unusual or complicated features of the language are not discussed. The chapter concludes with a presentation of a small robot planning system that uses only the language features presented in the chapter. Chapter Three presents a series of examples chosen to illustrate solutions to automatic programming problems. The QA4 programs used in Chapter Three rely on language features not presented in the primer. They are, however, explained as they occur. These programs illustrate most of the programming concepts just discussed. Chapter Four is a complete reference guide to the language. It provides the semantics of all the features of the language together with many implementation notes and design rationale. Chapter Five discusses extensions to the language that will probably be done during the next year.",
