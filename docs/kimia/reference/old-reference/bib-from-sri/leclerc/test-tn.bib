component = Multiple Agents!Planning
component =   In this report, we describe the search algorithm of the
component = GEMPLAN multiagent planning system.  The search algorithm is based
component = upon the GEMPLAN domain description and its localized constraint
component = representation.  The problem domain is structured into regions of
component = activity, and each region has its own set of local constraints.  The
component = search is a constraint-satisfaction process; it tries to find a plan
component = in each region by satisfying the region's constraints.  Therefore, the
component = search space is subdivided into regional search trees.  Unfortunately,
component = these search trees cannot be searched independently.  However, the
component = situation is much better than global search because GEMPLAN's
component = constraint localization, together with the domain structure, precisely
component = define when the search in one region can affect another region, and
component = hence how control must shift from one search tree to another.
component = 	To avoid any confusion, this report does not describe GEMPLAN,
component = but only its generic localized search algorithm.  We only explain and
component = abstract features of GEMPLAN on which this search algorithm is based.
component = As a result, this algorithm is applicable to any other
component = constraint-satisfaction problem with characteristics similar to
component = GEMPLAN.
