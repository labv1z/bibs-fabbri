Our current work focuses primarily on interpreting multimodal inputs and adapting to available output modalities.  We anticipate providing more intelligent production of multimodal output in future systems.
We have an agent-based system architecture that we use to allow us to incrementally add functionality, and to substitute alternative handling of individual modalities.}

  During the past year, significant improvements have been made in the
  natural-language processing technology used in the SRI ATIS
  spoken-language understanding system.  The principal developments have
  been (1) the incorporation of information from the natural-language
  grammar and lexicon into a statistical language model that is used in
  both speech recognition and language understanding, (2) implementation
  of a robust interpretation component that constructs queries out of
  grammatical fragments when an utterance cannot be analyzed as a single
  phrase or utterance, and (3) a new context mechanism for air travel
  planning that constructs an explicit model of the user's intended
  itinerary.

  Automated deduction techniques are being used in a system called
  Amphion to derive, from graphical specifications, programs composed
  from a subroutine library.  The system has been applied to construct
  software for the planning and analysis of interplanetary missions.

  The library for that application is a collection of subroutines
  written in FORTRAN-77 at JPL to perform computations in solar-system
  kinematics.  An application domain theory has been developed that
  describes the procedures in a portion of the library, as well as some
  basic properties of solar-system astronomy, in the form of first-order
  axioms.

  Specifications are elicited from the user through a menu-driven
  graphical user interface; space scientists have found the graphical
  notation congenial.  The specification is translated into a theorem,
  which is proved constructively in the astronomical domain theory by an
  automated theorem prover, SNARK.  An applicative program is
  extracted from the proof and converted to FORTRAN-77.  By the
  method of its construction, the program is guaranteed to meet the
  given specification and requires no further verification, provided, of
  course, that the specification, domain theory, and system itself are
  correct.

  Amphion has successfully constructed more than a hundred programs to
  solve problems, formulated at NASA Ames, JPL, and Stanford, which
  involve typical computations involving the sun, planets, moons, and
  spacecraft.  The system is currently being alpha tested at JPL.
