ABSTRACT="A new formulation of the image partitioning problem is
presented: construct a complete and stable description of an image, in
terms of a specified descriptive language, that is simplest in the sense
of being shortest. We show that a descriptive language limited to a
low-order polynomial description of the intensity variation within each
region and a chain-code-like description of the region boundaries yields
intuitively satisfying partitions for a wide class of images. <p> The
advantage of this formulation is that it can be extended to deal with
subsequent steps of the image-understanding problem (or to deal with
other image attributes, such as texture) in a natural way by augmenting
the descriptive language. Experiments performed on a variety of both
real and synthetic images demonstrate the superior performance of this
approach over partitioning techniques based on clustering vectors of
local image attributes and standard edge-detection techniques.",

ABSTRACT="We present a method of recovering shape from shading that
solves directly for the surface height. By using a discrete formulation
of the problem, we are able to achieve good convergence behavior by
employing numerical solution techniques more powerful than gradient
descent methods derived from variational calculus. Because we directly
solve for height, we avoid the problem of finding an integrable surface
maximally consistent with surface orientation. Furthermore, since we do
not need additional constraints to make the problem well posed, we use a
smoothness constraint only to drive the system towards a good solution;
the weight of the smoothness term is eventually reduced to near zero.
Also, by solving directly for height, we can use stereo processing to
provide initial and boundary conditions. Our shape from shading
technique, as well as its relation to stereo, is demonstrated on both
synthetic and real imagery.",

AUTHOR="Leclerc, Y. G. and Fischler, M. A.",
TITLE="An {Optimization-Based} Approach to the Interpretation of Single
Line Drawings as {3-D} Wire Frames",
JOURNAL="International Journal of Computer Vision",
YEAR=1992,
VOLUME=9,
NUMBER=2,
PAGES="113-136",
MONTH=nov,
ABSTRACT="Line drawings provide an effective means of communication
about the geometry of 3-D objects. An understanding of how to duplicate
the way humans interpret line drawings is extremely important in
enabling man-machine communication with respect to images, diagrams, and
spatial constructs. In particular, such an understanding could be used
to provide the human with the capability to create a line-drawing sketch
of a polyhedral object that the machine can automatically convert into
the intended 3-D model. <p> A recently published paper \cite{Marill91}
presented a simple optimization procedure supposedly able to duplicate
human judgment in recovering the 3-D ``wire frame'' geometry of objects
depicted in line drawings. Marill provided some impressive examples, but
no theoretical justification for his approach. In this paper we
introduce our own work by first critically examining Marill's algorithm.",
ANNOTE="We provide an explanation for why Marill's algorithm was able to
perform as well as it did on the examples he presented, discuss its
weaknesses, and show very simple examples where it fails. We then
provide an algorithm that improves on Marill's results. In particular,
we show that an effective objective function must favor both symmetry
and planarity---Marill deals only with the symmetry issue. By modifying
Marill's objective function to explicitly favor planar-faced solutions,
and by using a more competent optimization technique, we were able to
demonstrate significantly improved performance in all of the examples
Marill provided and those additional ones we constructed ourselves.
Finally, we examine some questions relevant to the implications of this
work for understanding the human ability to interpret line drawings.",
