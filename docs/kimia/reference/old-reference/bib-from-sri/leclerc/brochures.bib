@BOOKLET{EW-TAD,
TITLE = "Antiair Threat Identification",
ABSTRACT = "This application of SRI's evidential reasoning technology uses
models of antiair threat and emitter operations such as SA-6 and PATHAND,
in combination with continuously valued environmental constraints such as
clarity, illumination, and range, to probabilistically identify antiair
threats and their modes of operation based upon sensor reports.",

TITLE = "Composing Astronomical Software",
ABSTRACT = "SRI's automated deduction system SNARK has been successfully
applied to the problem of constructing software for planning interplanetary
scientific missions.  Based upon a graphical specification elicited from
the user, software modules are automatically composed from a large NASA
library of subroutines.  The derived software is guaranteed to meet the
specification.",

TITLE = "Autonomous Vehicle Control",
ABSTRACT = "The combination of SRI's fuzzy logic, local perceptual space,
and procedural reasoning technologies provides for flexible, robust control
of an autonomous vehicle operating within an (unmodified) office
environment.  Purposeful behaviors (e.g., going to a specific location) are
dynamically blended with reactive behaviors (e.g., avoiding a moving
obstacle) to provide smooth and compliant control of the vehicle as it
navigates according to a strategic plan.",

to detect and localize submarines.  Depending upon the extent of the area
of uncertain surrounding a detected submarine's location, hydrophone
deployment patterns are intelligently selected and applied until the
uncertain is resolved.",

highlights its ability to simultaneously reason with hard constraints, such
as island barriers and maximum speed of vehicles, in combination with
diverse sources of soft constraints of varying credibility, such as reports
from stationary sensors, mobile sensors, direct sightings, and indirect
