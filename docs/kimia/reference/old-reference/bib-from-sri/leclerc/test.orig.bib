ABSTRACT="A new formulation of the image partitioning problem is
presented: construct a complete and stable description of an image, in
terms of a specified descriptive language, that is simplest in the sense
of being shortest. We show that a descriptive language limited to a
low-order polynomial description of the intensity variation within each
region and a chain-code-like description of the region boundaries yields
intuitively satisfying partitions for a wide class of images. <p> The
advantage of this formulation is that it can be extended to deal with
subsequent steps of the image-understanding problem (or to deal with
other image attributes, such as texture) in a natural way by augmenting
the descriptive language. Experiments performed on a variety of both
real and synthetic images demonstrate the superior performance of this
approach over partitioning techniques based on clustering vectors of
local image attributes and standard edge-detection techniques.",
