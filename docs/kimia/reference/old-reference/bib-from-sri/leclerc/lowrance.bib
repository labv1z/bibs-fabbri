ABSTRACT="Evidential Reasoning (ER) is a body of techniques for automated
reasoning from evidence that is based upon the mathematics of
Dempster-Shafer belief functions.  The emphasis of this project was
twofold: to broaden and solidify the theoretical basis of ER, and
to facilitate the transfer of the intellectual technology embodied
in ER.  As part of our theoretical effort, we established a sound
semantics for Dempster-Shafer belief functions, deriving the
Dempster-Shafer axioms based upon epistemic logic; we derived all ER
operations from these same Dempster-Shafer axioms; we established ER as
a generalization of both logical and Bayesian probabilistic reasoning;
we identified the conditions under which the computational complexity of
ER belief networks can be reduced; we developed a theoretically
justified means of propagating all information throughout an evidential
analysis, determining the global impact on all probabilistically
dependent random variables; we incorporated decision theoretic concepts
into ER, including sensitivity analysis and decision trees. To
facilitate the transfer of this technology, we developed intuitive
graphical structures for representing and manipulating evidential
knowledge, thereby, substantially reducing the time required to compile
and organize the knowledge for a new application domain, and we
developed a set of canonical ER examples covering a range of application
domains, including underwater vehicle tracking, antiair threat
identification, medical diagnosis, and robot vehicle navigation."}

supports the construction, modification, and interrogation of lines of

We believe that the current Gister system could offer significant aid

generalized argument construction, the central requirement of
real-world analysis."}

ABSTRACT="Over the past five years the Artificial Intelligence Center at SRI has
been developing a new technology to address the problem of automated
information management within real-world contexts.  The result of this
work is a body of techniques for automated reasoning from evidence
that we call {\it evidential reasoning}.  The techniques are based
upon the mathematics of belief functions developed by Dempster and
Shafer and have been successfully applied to a variety of problems
including computer vision, multisensor integration, and intelligence
analysis.

We have developed both a formal basis and a framework for
implementating automated reasoning systems based upon these
techniques.  Both the formal and practical approach can be divided
into four parts: (1) specifying a set of distinct propositional
spaces, (2) specifying the interrelationships among these spaces, (3)
representing bodies of evidence as belief distributions, and (4)
establishing paths for the bodies of evidence to move through these
spaces by means of evidential operations, eventually converging on
spaces where the target questions can be answered.  These steps
specify a means for arguing from multiple bodies of evidence toward a
particular (probabilistic) conclusion.  Argument construction is the
process by which such evidential analyses are constructed and is the
analogue of constructing proof trees in a logical context.

This technology features the ability to reason from uncertain,
incomplete, and occasionally inaccurate information based upon seven
evidential operations: fusion, discounting, translating, projection,
summarization, interpretation, and gisting.  These operation are
theoretically sound but have intuitive appeal as well.

In implementing this formal approach, we have found that evidential
arguments can be represented as graphs.  To support the construction,
modification, and interrogation of evidential arguments, we have
developed Gister.  Gister provides an interactive, menu-driven,
graphical interface that allows these graphical structures to be
easily manipulated.

Our goal is to provide effective automated aids to domain experts for
argument construction.  Gister represents our first attempt at such an
aid."}

ABSTRACT="Toward the goal of providing automated aides for intelligence analysis,
SRI, in cooperation with DARPA and NAVALEX, developed a system called
Navint. Navint is an interactive system that aids naval intelligence
analysts in estimating the location and activity of surface vessels, based
upon a variety of intelligence reports from multiple sources.  It focuses
on ship-by-ship estimates, using these as the basis for a fleet wide
summary.  The analyst interacts with the system through a set of display
windows.  The primary window is a ledger or ``timeline'' that is used to
record and organize the daily intelligence data and products for each ship.
The mode of interaction is modeled after electronic spread-sheet programs.
As the analyst fills in the (electronic) form with the available
information, Navint automatically updates related entries.  A different
view of this same information is provided through ``map'' windows.  These
display the presumed routes of individual fleet elements overlaid on maps
of the appropriate areas.  Another display tracks the flow of intelligence
information through evidential-reasoning operations (e.g., discounting,
fusing, translation, and projection).  When a new report is entered by the
analyst, a new node is created in this ``analysis'' display to represent
the newly acquired information. The application of evidential-reasoning
operations spawns new nodes related to preexisting ones.  When new nodes
are created, labeled links are created between these nodes to trace the
heritage of each resulting body of information.  Thus, explanations of
selected conclusions can be generated by tracing back along these links to
find the supporting reports and to determine their relative roles."}

that they must draw conclusions on the basis of evidential
information. Yet there is very little agreement of how this should be
done. Here we present our current understanding of this problem and
some partial solutions. We begin by characterizing evidence as
information that is uncertain, incomplete, and sometimes
inaccurate. Based on this characterization, we conclude that
evidential reasoning requires both a method for pooling multiple
bodies of evidence to arrive at a consensus opinion and some means of
drawing the appropriate conclusions from that opinion. We contrast our
approach, based on a relatively new mathematical theory of evidence,
with those approaches bases on Bayesian probability models. We believe
that our approach has some significant advantages, particularly its
ability to represent and reason from bounded ignorance."}

ABSTRACT="Dependency-graph models of evidential support are formal systems
capable of pooling and extending evidential information, while maintaining
internal consistency. In this formalism, the likelihood of a proposition is
represented as a subinterval of the until interval.  The lower bound
represents the degree of ``support'' provided a proposition by a body of
evidence, and the upper bound represents the extent to which it remains
``plausible.''  The smaller this interval, the more precisely the probability
of that proposition is known.
	
Evidential information, extracted from the environment by
(indivisible) sources of knowledge, enters these models in the form of
probability "mass" distributions, defined over sets of propositions common
to both them and the model.  Theses mass distributions are combined through
Dempster's rule of combination [Dempster 1967].  The result is a new mass
distribution representing their consensus.  Next, this pooled information
is extended from those propositions it directly bears upon, to those it
indirectly bears upon, and converted to the interval representation.  Prior
probabilities, frequently difficult or impossible to collect in artificial
intelligence domains, but required by most other systems of inexact
reasoning, are not needed. This form of evidential reasoning, based on
[Shafer 1976], is more general than either a Boolean or Bayesian approach,
providing for Boolean and Bayesian inferencing when the appropriate
information is available.
	
Dependency graphs are formal representations of dependency
relations. A dependency graph consists of a set of propositions (nodes), a
covering assignment of confidences (node values), and a coordinated set of
dependency relationships (connecting arcs) constraining the assignment of
confidences.  Confidences can be fully specified (a single value),
partially specified (several values), or unspecified (all values).
Similarly, a dependency graph can describe any degree of
dependence/independence among its propositions.  The freedom to express
partial information makes dependency graphs suitable for modeling the
degrees of belief one should accord a group of related propositions based
on evidential information, a suitable host for Shafer's theory."}

ABSTRACT="GRASPER 1.0 is a programming language extension. Once
appended to a host language, GRASPER 1.0 introduces graphs, diagrams
consisting of points connected by lines or arrows, as a primitive data
type. 

The primary feature of GRASPER 1.0's design is that the language, its
documentation, and its implementation all share a common
organizational structure that groups GRASPER 1.0 primitives according
to their scope of application and the underlying concepts from which
they are formed. Although this report is of a descriptive nature, a
similar approach might well be prescribed for other applications. 

GRASPER 1.0 is based on a small number of underlying concepts. GRASPER
1.0 primitives are constructed from these concepts according to a
small set of rules. The name of each GRASPER 1.0 primitive
systematically reflects its underlying concepts. This generative
nature of the language organizes a large set of primitives in a
cognitively efficient way. This makes GRASPER 1.0 easier to learn and
retain; proves an indexing system for GRASPER 1.0 documentation; and
serves as an outline for well-structured implementations.  

GRASPER 1.0 has been implemented with LISP 1.5 as the host
language. This implementation supports a software-level virtual memory
management system for graph storage. Spaces, user defined subgraphs,
are used by the virtual memory manager to group logically related
information  on the same pages, helping to reduce paging. Multiple
storage schemes allow users to optimize the way graphs are stored
based on their particular applications."}

ABSTRACT="This paper introduces a formal method for integrating
knowledge derived from a variety of sources for use in ``perceptual
reasoning.'' The formalism is based on the ``evidential propositional
calculus.'' a derivative of Shafer's mathematical theory of evidence
[Shafer 1976]. It is more general than either a Boolean or Bayesian
approach, providing for Boolean and Bayesian inferencing when the
appropriate information is available. In this formalism, the likelihood
of a proposition A is represented as a subinterval, [s(A),p(A)], of
the unit interval [0,1]. The evidential support for the proposition A
is represented by s(A), while p(A) represents its degree of
plausibility; p(A) can also be interpreted as the degree to which one
fails to doubt A, p(A) being equal to one minus the evidential support
for ~A. This paper describes how evidential information, furnished by
a knowledge source in the form of a probability ``mass'' distribution,
can be converted to this interval representation; how, through a set
of inference rules for computing intervals of dependent propositions,
this information can be extrapolated from those propositions it
directly bears upon, to those it indirectly bears upon; and how
multiple bodies of evidential information can be pooled. A sample
application of this approach, modeling the operation of a collection
of sensors (a particular type of knowledge source), illustrates these
techniques."}

ABSTRACT="This paper introduces a formal method for integrating
knowledge derived from a variety of sources for use in ``perceptual
reasoning.'' The formalism is based on the ``evidential propositional
calculus.'' a derivative of Shafer's mathematical theory of evidence
[Shafer 1976]. It is more general than either a Boolean or Bayesian
approach, providing for Boolean and Bayesian inferencing when the
appropriate information is available. In this formalism, the likelihood
of a proposition A is represented as a subinterval, [s(A),p(A)], of
the unit interval [0,1]. The evidential support for the proposition A
is represented by s(A), while p(A) represents its degree of
plausibility; p(A) can also be interpreted as the degree to which one
fails to doubt A, p(A) being equal to one minus the evidential support
for ~A. This paper describes how evidential information, furnished by
a knowledge source in the form of a probability ``mass'' distribution,
can be converted to this interval representation; how, through a set
of inference rules for computing intervals of dependent propositions,
this information can be extrapolated from those propositions it
directly bears upon, to those it indirectly bears upon; and how
multiple bodies of evidential information can be pooled. A sample
application of this approach, modeling the operation of a collection
of sensors (a particular type of knowledge source), illustrates these
techniques."}

ABSTRACT="The primary objective of these two-year efforts was to extend the available
AI-based techniques for drawing conclusions from multisource information.
The specific problem addressed was that of integrating sensor data with
prior knowledge in order to update and maintain a current threat order of
battle for a penetrating aircraft.  The goal was to provide an automated
capability to replace the judgemental capabilities of a human operator in
interpreting the returns from his on-board sensors to best assess the
antiair threats arrayed against him. The key problems were to find a way of
representing and reasoning about the wide variety of knowledge sources a
human operator would normally invoke in performing this task.  A secondary
objective was to demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques by
simulating the interaction of sensors such as radar warning systems and an
optical augmentation device. The results of this simulation demonstrated
that the optical augmentation device could be automatically cued by the
radar warning receiver and resulted in a decrease in the overall false
alarm rate and an increase in the number of successful detections. The work
also resulted in the development and demonstrated the utility of a new
collection of inference techniques labeled evidential reasoning. These
techniques represented a significant advance in the state of the art of
methods for reasoning with uncertain knowledge."}

ABSTRACT="We address recent criticisms of evidential reasoning, an
approach to the analysis of imprecise and uncertain information that
is based on the Dempster-Shafer calculus of evidence.

We show that evidential reasoning can be interpreted in terms of
classical probability theory and that the Dempster-Shafer calculus of
evidence may be considered to be a form of generalized probabilistic
reasoning based on the representation of probabilistic ignorance by
intervals of possible values. In particular, we emphasize that it is
not necessary to resort to nonprobabilistic or subjectivist
explanations to justify the validity of the approach.

We answer conceptual criticisms of evidential reasoning primarily on
the basis of the criticism's confusion between the current state of
development of the theory---mainly theoretical limitations in the
treatment of conditional information---and it potential usefulness in
treating a wide variety of uncertainty analysis problems. Similarly, we
indicate that the supposed lack of decision-support schemes  of
generalized probability approaches is not a theoretical handicap but
rather an indication of basic informational shortcoming that is a
desirable asset of any formal approximate reasoning approach. We also
point to potential shortcomings of the underlying representation
scheme to treat general probabilistic reasoning problems.

We also consider methodological criticisms of the approach, focusing
primarily on the alleged counterintuitive nature of Dempster's
combination formula, showing that such results are the result of its
misapplication. We also address issues of complexity and validity of
scope of the calculus of evidence."}
