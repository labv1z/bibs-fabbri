ABSTRACT="An account of utterance interpretation in discourse needs to face the
issue of how the discourse context controls the space of interacting
preferences. 
In the framework of a general discourse processing model that
integrates both the grammar and pragmatics subsystems, I propose
a fine structure of the preferential interpretation in pragmatics in
terms of defeasible rule interactions. The pronoun interpretation
preferences that serve as the empirical ground draw from the survey
data specifically obtained for the present purpose.",

ABSTRACT="We report on the strategies in automatic summarization of spontaneous
spoken dialogues. Our dialogue summarization system, MIMI, recognizes
key linguisitc patterns and merges information to construct a summary
of conference room scheduling dialogues. Dialogues about single
reservations can be accurately summarized with a simple merging
scheme, but we need several extensions and changes to cope with the
{\it aboutness complexity} in unrestricted dialogues --- knowing
exactly {\it how many} reservations are being discussed and {\it
which} reservation values must be updated by subsequent utterances. A
side effect of these extensions is a new problem of overrecognition
caused by spoken language disfluencies.",

ABSTRACT="We present a semantic and pragmatic account of the anaphoric
properties of past and perfect that improves on previous work by
integrating discourse structure, aspectual type, surface structure and
commonsense knowledge.  A novel aspect of our account is that we
distinguish between two kinds of temporal intervals in the
interpretation of temporal operators --- discourse reference intervals
and event intervals.  This distinction makes it possible to develop an
analogy between centering and temporal centering, which operates on
discourse reference intervals. Our {\it temporal property-sharing
principle} is a defeasible inference rule on the logical form.  Along
with lexical and causal reasoning, it plays a role in incrementally
resolving underspecified aspects of the event structure representation
of an utterance against the current context.",

ABSTRACT="As discourse unfolds, the participants keep
track of a shared information state that is dynamically updated in a
chain of transitions.  This shared information state is a bundle of
both explicitly asserted and implicitly assumed pieces of information,
and the role of a linguistic utterance is to make explicit only what
does not follow from the currently shared information.  Discourse
understanding thus combines both linguistic interpretation and
commonsense reasoning. It is essential that a theory of discourse
account for their interactions. These points are illustrated with an
analysis of a piece of discourse --- the AI puzzle of {\it
missionaries and cannibals} --- in both English and Japanese.  The
approach is an information-based dynamic discourse analysis where the
shared information states consist of situation types and information
pieces. The analysis shows that the `linguistic wrapping' of the
puzzle in either language admits of systematic explanation though it
affects neither the core problem nor how it is solved.",

ABSTRACT="Discourse processing is a sequence of dynamic operations 
on transient 
information states.  As discourse unfolds, the participants keep track 
of a shared information state that is dynamically updated in a chain 
of transitions.  This shared information state is a bundle of both 
explicitly asserted and implicitly assumed pieces of information.  The 
role of a linguistic utterance is to make explicit only what does not 
follow from the currently shared information.  Discourse understanding 
thus combines both linguistic interpretation and commonsense 
reasoning. It is essential that a theory of discourse account for 
their interactions. 

These points are illustrated with an analysis of a piece of discourse 
--- the AI puzzle of `Missionaries and Cannibals'.  The approach is an 
information-based dynamic discourse analysis with the following 
features: (1) an information state consists of salient situation types 
and information pieces, (2) the use of each referring expression type 
has a set of dynamic constraints in terms of pre- and post-conditions 
on the information state. The approach exposes the systematic 
dynamicity in linguistic processing that has tended to be either taken 
for granted without explanation or neglected in the studies of 
commonsense reasoning in AI. The same approach is used to analyze 
equivalent texts in English and Japanese demonstrating its 
cross-linguistic applicability.

ABSTRACT="Languages differ in the concepts and real-world entities for which
they have words and grammatical constructs. Therefore translation
must sometimes be a matter of approximating the meaning of a source
language text rather than finding an exact counterpart in the target
language. We propose a translation framework based on Situation
Theory. The basic 
ingredients are an information lattice, a representation scheme 
for utterances embedded in contexts, and a mismatch resolution 
scheme defined in terms of information flow. 
We motivate our approach with examples of translation
between English and Japanese.",

ABSTRACT="We describe a prototype Shared Grammar for the syntax of
simple nominal expressions in Arabic, English, French, German, and
Japanese implemented at MCC. In this grammar, a complex inheritance
lattice of shared grammatical templates provides parts that each
language can put together to form language--specific grammatical
templates. We conclude that grammar sharing is not only possible but
also desirable. If forces us to reveal cross--linguistically invariant
grammatical primitives that may otherwise remain conflated with other
primitives if we deal only with a single language or language type. We
call this the process of Grammatical Atomization. The specific
implementation reported here uses categorial unification grammar. The
topics include the mono--level nominal category N, the functional
distinction between ARGUMENT and NON--ARGUMENT of nominals,
grammatical agreement, and word order types.",

ABSTRACT="A constraint is proposed in the centering approach to
pronoun resolution in discourse. This `property--sharing' constraint
requires that two pronominal expressions that retain the same Cb
across adjacent utterances share a certain common grammatical
property. This property is expressed along the dimention of the
grammatical function SUBJECT for both Japanese and English discourses,
where different pronominal forms are primarily used to realize the
Cb. It is the zero pronominal in Japanese, and the (unstressed) overt
pronoun in English. The resulting constraint complements the original
Centering Rule, accounting for its apparent violations and providing a
solution to the interpretation of multi--pronominal utterances. It
also provides an alternative account of anaphora interpretation that
appears to be due to structural parallelism. This reconcilation of
centering/focusing and parallelism is a major advantage. I will then
add another dimension called the `speaker identification' to the
constraint to handle a group of special cases in Japanese
discourse. It indicates a close association between centering and the
speaker's viewpoint, and sheds light on what underlies the effect of
perception reports on pronoun resolution in general. These results, by
drawing on facts in two very different languages, demonstrate the
cross--linguistic applicability of the centering framework.",

TITLE="Zero Anaphora: The Case of Japanese",

ABSTRACT="Zero pronominals (i.e., unexpressed subjects and objects) are
pervasive in Japanese. I investigate their discourse functions and
syntactic constraints drawing on the centering approach (Sidner 1983;
Grosz, Joshi, & Weinstein 1983) to discourse analysis and the
lexical-functional theory (Bresnan ed. 1982) in syntax. I show that
they encode the Center (i.e., the entity an utterance most centrally
concerns), and posit Center-establishment and Center-retention rules.
These and the Expected Center Order among referring expressions give
rise to preference rules for identifying the Center in Japanese
discourse. I then argue that their essential syntactic properties
simply follow from two factors; (a) their Center-encoding role in
discourse and (b) the mere fact that they are absent from the
constituent structure. These results can be integrated into a zero
pronominal interpretation model where the Center rules crucially
contribute to the control of inferences.",
