abstract="A prerequisite to a theory of the way agents understand
speech acts is a theory of how their beliefs and intentions are revised
as a consequence of events.  This process of attitude revision is an
interesting domain for the application of nonmonotonic reasoning because
speech acts have a conventional aspect that is readily represented by
defaults, but that interacts with an agent's beliefs and intentions in
many complex ways that may override the defaults.  Perrault has
developed a theory of speech acts, based on Reiter's default logic, that
captures the conventional aspect; it does not, however, adequately
account for certain easily observed facts about attitude revision
resulting from speech acts.  A natural theory of attitude revision seems
to require a method of stating preferences among competing defaults.
We present here a speech act theory, formalized in hierarchic autoepistemic
logic (a refinement of Moore's autoepistemic logic), in which revision of
both the speaker's and hearer's attitudes can be adequately described.
As a collateral benefit, efficient automatic reasoning methods for the
formalism exist.  The theory has been implemented and is now being employed
by an utterance-planning system."
