[ ... ] I am aware about some work on grasping that involved my method
of recovering superquadric volumetric models from range data (IEEE
PAMI-12(2):131-147, 1990).  I am afraid that I don't have their papers
at hand but one group that worked on the problem of grasping is at
Columbia University (dr. Peter Allen) and another at Carnegie_Mellon
University (dr. Eric Krotkov). I am sure that they would be happy to
send you their latest work on that subject.

My dissertation (which I will defend next Friday)
"Learning and Forgetting for Perception Action: A Projection Pursuit
and Density Adaptive Approach," deals with learning
to grasp based on shape descriptors (superquadrics) and object pose
using  memory-based learning approaches.

[ ... ] There is very little other work in _shape_ driven
grasping that I have found. [ ... ]

Sharon Stansfield (formerly of UPenn, now at Sandia Nat'l Labs) did
some work on grasping in the mid-late eighties. Her's was more (I
think) from the tactile point of view but you might want to check how
much attention she paid to aspects of visual processing.  Also, I
don't know what exactly she's been doing in the last 4-5 years, so
check it out.

I think people at the MIT AI lab have done a lot of work on this.

Try sending mail to "publications@ai.mit.edu" to get a list of

I'm afraid I can give you only very sketchy references (based on memory) as
I am away this summer, but I can think of three possibilities:

1. Octree representation
   You should check out IROS 91 proceedings; it has a paper on grasp planning
   that you might be interested in. Basically the approach is to slice the
   volume and from analysis of adjacent slices, produces possible grasp sites.
   The authors are from Italy, if I am not mistaken.
2. Boundary/surface extraction
   Stansfield of Sandia Labs did her Ph.D. on grasp planning using range
   data. She has a paper in ICRA 87 or 88.
3. Superquadric representation
   This has been used at CMU. The project involves modeling rocks using
   superquadrics and aligning the gripper parallel to the major axis prior to
   picking up the rock. If you require more information, you can e-mail
   ki@cs.cmu.edu (Katsushi Ikeuchi).

I'm well out of touch with this area, but every time I open
IEEE robotics and automation I seem to see something on this.
The work of Kumar and Waldron always seems conceptually good
to me, and Cutkosky is worth reading to.  He wrote an
introductory book a few years ago, which has a lot of interesting
ideas.

I have started some work related to this, but I will use a simulation
of a multifingered robot hand, and I will use algorithms of the
domain of neural computation.
You are tackling a very difficult problem that has not been solved
yet. But for references you should check the last years' issues of
the Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference of Robotics and
Automation and try to find something with the Science Citation Index
(SCI).
Good luck!

I saw your request for info on 3D grasp planning.
I did my MS thesis on CAD based grasp planning.  They were
3D models.  The parallel jaw gripper had to be able to plan a
grasp from any orientation.  What I did (to simplify the computations),
was to rotate the model as needed so that the pair of faces that I was
planning a grasp on were parallel to the XY plane.  After determining
the "quality" of the grasp, I unrotated the gripper.  This gives you
what you were asking for, I believe.

You can read about in the proceedings of the 1989 IEEE Conference on
Robotics and Automation, Vol. 1 (as I recall), entitled something like
"CAD-Based Grasp Planning Using Polygons, Edges, and Vertexes," author
Lance B. Gatrell.

I'm curious to know if this helps, and what happens with your work.
