Meaning of the non-standard entries

read = "mr"		private flag, I read that
notread = "mr"		private flag, I didn't read that
private = "mr"		private flag, I have my own copy of that on paper

in note:
[ETHICS <number>]	Aviable under that number in ETH Zurich Main Library
[OMR2] or [OMR3]	I have a paper copy in that very binder
[ETZ]			Aviable in the ETH Zurich EE Library, ETZ Building
