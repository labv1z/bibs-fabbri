This directory contains a compiled bibliography on the subject
of Optical Music Recognition.

Version of: Dec, 1992

The BibTeX sources (ascii text, readable) are the three files 
with .bib extension and can be used to create your own 
bibliographies with TeX. 

The final bibliography is aviable in three version as postscript
file with extension .ps.

All files are UNIX-compressed (ending with an additional .Z).
If that's a problem for you, just mail me. On unix systems,
you should be able to 'uncompress <file>', and print the 
postscript files with 'lpr *.ps'. 

- Currently, there are raw (uncompressed) files in the subdirectory
  "uncompressed" in case you can't handle *.Z files.

Make sure to set binary mode ('bin') before ftp'ing compressed
files!

Any questions, comments, additions are welcome!
