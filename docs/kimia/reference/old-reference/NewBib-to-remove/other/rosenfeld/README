Dr. Azriel Rosenfeld's Bibliography.

For each year of the bibliography, there are  two  files;  a
pre-imagen  file (e.g.  preimagen.biblio.1988) in troff for-
mat (using our own bibliography macro package, mebib) and  a
text  file  (e.g. biblio.text.1988), which is the pre-imagen
file run through nroff and edited a bit.

Also included  is  our  bibliographic  troff  macro  package
tmacs.ebib  (to  provide  the  -mebib option for troff).  It
should be installed in /usr/lib/tmacs  (or  where  ever  you
keep you troff macro packages), if you want to be able to do
anything with the preimagen.biblio files.

The bibliography files occupy under 3.5 MBytes.
