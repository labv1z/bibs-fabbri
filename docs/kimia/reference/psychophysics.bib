                  similarity as an explanatory construct with a focus
                  on similarity judgments. For similarity to be a
                  useful construct, one must be able to specify the
                  ways or respects in which two things are similar.
                  One solution to this problem is to restrict the
                  notion of similarity to hard-wired perceptual
                  processes. It is argued that this view is too narrow
                  and limiting. Instead, it is proposed that an
                  important source of constraints derives from the
                  similarity comparison process itself. Both new
                  experiments and other evidence are described that
                  support the idea that respects are determined by
                  processes internal to comparisons."

	abstract = {Classic research on conceptual hierarchies has shown that the interaction between the human perceiver and objects in the environment specifies one level of abstraction for categorizing objects, called the basic level, which plays a primary role in cognition. The question of whether the special psychological status of the basic level can be modified by experience was addressed in three experiments comparing the performance of subjects in expert and novice domains. The main findings were that in the domain of expertise (a) subordinate-level categories were as differentiated as the basic-level categories, (b) subordinate-level names were used as frequently as basic-level names for identifying objects, and (c) subordinate-level categorizations were as fast as basic-level categorizations. Taken together, these results demonstrate that individual differences in domain-specific knowledge affect the extent that the basic level is central to categorization.},
